FRANCOIS VILLEROY DE GALHAU, GOVERNOR, BANK OF FRANCE, IS INTERVIEWED ON BB TV JANUARY 26, 2018 SPEAKERS: FRANCOIS VILLEROY DE GALHAU, GOVERNOR, BANK OF FRANCE FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG NEWS [*] FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: We are joined by Francois Villeroy de Galhau. He's governor of the Bank of France and ECB governing member. So, we'll get on to that euro-dollar spat we saw started here in Davos in the last couple of day. We'll also talk about inflation expectation, and all of that. But, first, Governor, good morning and thank you for coming on. FRANCOIS VILLEROY DE GALHAU, GOVERNOR, BANK OF FRANCE: Good morning. LACQUA: I want to talk to you about something that's very close to your heart and that's European reforms. You can do as much monetary policy as you want. But if we don't have sustained growth that is coupled with reforms, then it could end wrongly. At what kind of level of the cycle are we for European reforms? DE GALHAU: This is probably one of the messages of these Davos meetings this year, that Europe is back. So, without (INAUDIBLE), but we have an acceleration of European growth. The euro is a success. It's supported by 74 percent of European citizens. But we still have to complete European economic and monetary union on economic pillar. And this is probably one of the priorities of this year, because if we don't strengthen this economic leg of E.U. monetary policy risks being overburdened by the next recession when it will come. So, we all agree, including in Germany, that monetary policy should not be the only game in town. It means strengthening the economic union. We have a historical window of opportunity with the stable government in France and hopefully Germany in the weeks to come. LACQUA: Yes. But Germany has been weakened. Angela Merkel has been weakened. Does that mean that actually European integration will be tougher to achieve? DE GALHAU: We will see. (INAUDIBLE) German discussions evolve in the coming weeks. There is a prospect of a pro-European grand coalition. It's a promising prospect, but we will se. It's up to Germans to decide. But if we look at the contents, there are three possible -- very practical accelerators for this economic union, knowing that the bulk of economic policy will remain domestic, without any dues (ph), and we need domestic reform. We will speak about France probably. So, the first thing is capital markets union, private resharing. It's a technical agenda, but it's very important. And here, French, and German, and other Europeans agree. LACQUA: Yes. DE GALHAU: So, the second accelerator is a better coordination of macroeconomic policies. And the third accelerator but to come at the third stage would be some kind of common fiscal capacity, especially for investment. And to put the three elements together, we probably need one day a Euro area finance minister. LACQUA: OK. Does Brexit make that easier? DE GALHAU: I don't think that Brexit changed this part of the story dramatically. But Brexit is probably one reason more for the 27 and the 19 inter (ph) Eurozone to strengthen our unity. LACQUA: How is France doing and do you have the correct monetary policy for your country, for France? DE GALHAU: It's the correct monetary policy for the Eurozone as a whole, including France. But if I come back to France, the acceleration of growth is quite impressive. If I look at the figures of last year, '17, we will have had a growth of 1.9 percent, strongest since 2011. Two hundred and eighty thousand net job creations. And a significant increase in business confidence and investment. And this business confidence is probably the main effect of the new government. I met here in Davos with several CEOs of major international banks. They are all interested by Paris as a financial center, especially in market activities. So, you feel something new and exciting in the air. LACQUA: So, this is what President Macron working on the animal spirits of France? DE GALHAU: President Macron came here to say that France is back, but France's back within Europe, which is important. And I must say, as an independent central banker, this new government has been quite efficient in accelerating reforms. LACQUA: Yes. DE GALHAU: If you look at what they did over the new labor laws passed and implemented in less than four months. Public deficit under 3 percent. This was a promise but they fulfilled it. And an alleviation of capital and investment taxes. What remains to be done, obviously, on reforms because we need to increase the potential growth in France. LACQUA: And, Governor, how many questions do you get above a high euro, the higher euro? DE GALHAU: Mario Draghi had the question yesterday at the press conference of the ECB. And as you noticed, we he had said that the recent volatility of the euro exchange rate is a (INAUDIBLE) uncertainty, which requires monitoring on its effect on the inflation outlook. This is what we said and clearly we have no exchange rate objective. But our only objective is price stability. So, inflation grows, too, but below 2 percent. And we have to monitor the effect of exchange rate on the inflation outlook (INAUDIBLE) some declaration. LACQUA: Right. But because of the U.S. treasury secretary showing up in Davos and effectively saying that a weak U.S. dollar is good for trade. Is this talking down a currency? And is that currency manipulation or currency wars? DE GALHAU: If I listen carefully yesterday, there were different declarations from different and very U.S. officials. LACQUA: The president, yes. DE GALHAU: But the only things that Mario Draghi, you remind it (ph), without quoting anybody, was his attempts of a reference agreed in common. And as late as last October in Washington, D.C., (INAUDIBLE) what we all said, including the new U.S. administration, was, I quote, that we will not exchange rates for competitive purposes. This sentence is very important and it remains the rule of the game. It's the rule of mutual trust, and not only for public authorities, also for business. LACQUA: You cannot target it, but were you -- do you ever worry more about inflation not taking hold or do you worry more about the exchange rate and higher euro -- (CROSSTALK) DE GALHAU: Again, our only mandate is about price stability. So, what we look at and this is what we said clearly, speaking of monitoring yesterday, is the effect on the inflation outlook. LACQUA: How can you be so sure that inflation will come to Europe? DE GALHAU: Because we see it in the last two years. If you remember two years ago, we had to deal with the danger of deflation. It's now over. It's the first success of our monetary policy. And the message we expressed yesterday was a message of confidence and patience. Confidence because we are confident that in the path of gradual normalization of our monetary policy, this gradual normalization of monetary policy is progressing in an efficient way towards our inflation target of 2 percent. But patience because we are not yet there. So, we still need an accommodative monetary policy. LACQUA: When will you change the language in communication to guide the market into something else? DE GALHAU: Can I insist on one thing on our accommodative monetary policy and perhaps on market expectation, our monetary policy is not a solo, relying only on net asset purchases and monthly figures which concentrates probably the attentions of the financial market. It's a part of it (ph). You have the net asset purchases, you have (INAUDIBLE) stock of existing assets and we said clearly we would reinvest and keep a high level, a high amount of stock for an extended period of time. You have the actual level of the interest-rate. And you have the forward guidance. This is (INAUDIBLE). And it's important when you look at our toolbox and market expectations. And the precise timing, we didn't discuss it yesterday and time will come, be patient. We gave predictability and extreme clarity until September due to our last fall October decision. And we will -- we are clear about the sequencing. We are clear about the direction of our monetary policy, a gradual normalization with our whole spectrum of instruments, this quartet (ph), to precise timing will depend on the data. LACQUA: What timing would you choose? If you were to decide now, given what you know now, would you change communication and (INAUDIBLE)? DE GALHAU: Now, we are predictable, but we are not very committed (ph). We still have three or four monetary meetings to decide. Three or four. So, be patient. LACQUA: So, you think the markets want to know too much? There was in the last couple of weeks, a repricing, right, of certain assets in U.K. bonds, especially German bonds. Why is that? Are they going to -- is the market going to quickly? DE GALHAU: We have a steady hands policy. We are extremely predictable in the direction of our monetary policy in the sequencing and until September, everybody knows exactly what will happen. So, again, this is predictability. Markets would always like to know more and more. LACQUA: It's their job. DE GALHAU: And to make prophesies (ph), this is probably the normal rule of the game. But our responsibility is to decide in due time. LACQUA: And, Governor, when you look at the Italian elections, so we'll be covering them on March the 4th, do you worry that they may be disruptive? DE GALHAU: This is a very important point about political uncertainty. Our role as a central bankers is not to worry about political uncertainty as such. It's a look at the economic consequences of political uncertainty. Remember where we were one year ago? Everybody expected parts of Eurozone, a major political uncertainty. And on the contrary, what we saw was more or less a Eurozone as an anchor of stability and economic growth. So, there are political questions in Germany. We mentioned them. There could be -- there will be political questions in Italy. It's not my role to comment. But so far, we have seen no economic consequences of this political uncertainty, which is a different situation in the Eurozone from, let's say, U.K. with Brexit. LACQUA: Do you ever worry that we're a little bit too optimistic about the prospect for Europe? This is -- it seems to be from last year, the year where, you know, growth is back, unemployment is going down, what's the black swan event? DE GALHAU: No, I would say it with other words (ph), as a central banker, including from my home country. There is room for confidence without any doubt. We are confident about the present growth cycle. But there is no room for complacency. And our role as public authorities is to use this window of opportunity, which is economic and perhaps political. I mentioned the Eurozone reform, to decide and implement the necessary reforms. These are domestic, including in France, we still need reforms on focus in training, all on public spending, and all these (ph) at the European level. So, confidence, yes. Complacency, no. LACQUA: That's very clear message. Thank you so much, Governor. We'll leave it there. That was the governor of the Bank of France, Francois Villeroy de Galhau. And, of course, he's also an ECB governing council member. [*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT*** THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.
