World Economie Affairs wanted to know about Trichet's views on the Asian crisis and on the prospects for the euro in the coming years.

The international communi\u00adTrichet: Regarding the Asian crisis, I think that one needs to use caution on the diagnosis because the situation is still evolving, and there is no consensus from the experts. I believe that we need to beware of two mistakes. The first mistake is to overrate the crisis. lt seems to me that the emerging Asian econornies are experiencing a growth crisis. They have had extraordinarily fast economic growth in the past few years under conditions that experience has proven are not sustainable in the long run. Yet, I think that it would be an error to say that we are faced with an absolutely severe structural crisis. We need to use the metaphor of a \"growth crisis\", which does not mask its seriousness, but doesn't ques-The second, and equally dangerous, mis\u00adtake would be to under\u00adestimate the crisis and misjudge it as identical to past crises, especially to the debt crises we encountered in the 1980s. It so happens that I was very active in the 1980s' debt restructur-lt would be ty is experiencing trans\u00adformations of great magnitude: the globali\u00adsation process and the interconnection of capi\u00adtal markets, which are both irreversible.

I believe that we should 43 as we see it today is very different from the one we knew ten years ago. We are living in a time of massive technological change and we have a tendency to underestimate its impor\u00adtance. For example, consider the WORLO ECONOMIC AFFAIRS e WINTER 199:J decrease of the cost of information-we have to take into account that this shock had not yet occurred in the early 1980s. It is also important to recognise that commercial banks, which used to play an essential part in international financial intermediation, now find themselves playing a far more modest role. Markets now play a more impor\u00adtant role, especially in financing devel\u00adopment in the emerging balance of payments deficit. This code of conduct will help to clarify each country's policies, including those on foreign direct investment (FOI), and make them easier to assess by interna\u00adtional investors. Similarly, there is a consensus on the view that FDI is a fundamental element in the orderly functioning of an inter\u00adconnected world because, in a way, FDI finds its own repayment matter in an amicable way. Therefore, we give lt a try. We are able to do so when a country has to deal with a liq\u00aduidity problem that can be settled by debt payment restructurings. We have a number of examples from the 1980s where countries managed to avoid the non-amicable settlement. In such cases, the situation appears much bet\u00adter. Korea managed to proceed through the amicable settlement. In one case, we talk of debt restructurings; in another one, of reschedulings. The first case is about maintaining pay\u00adments, the second one is about inter\u00adrupting them. economies. And we are now feeling the effects of inventions that derive from this process of marketisation. We should not mis\u00adjudge the present state of the world; nor should we We can't leave the wor/d economy to chance; we need regulations. in the nature of the investment. It is there\u00adfore anchored in the real economy, and the pair\u00ading of the financial sphere and real sphere becomes automatic and The second principle has to do with rescheduling. With debt rescheduling, we find ourselves in a situation where we have to obey a principle that also applied in the 1980s-each partner must make a proportionate effort. There is, in a way, an optimum of efforts that is required from ail parties if you want to find a solution to the crisis. It means that the affected country pro\u00adceeds by itself to an important adjust\u00adment-it puts the economy back on its feet. This is the country's contribution. Naturally, it is absolutely necessary to get the green light from the IMF and the international community showing that the efforts are appropriate. construct an international framework that would be obsolete as soon as it is built. We can't leave the world economy to chance; we need regulations. Yet, we also need to let changes take place, without restricting these changes in an incoherent way. That is the difficult task of our time-to draw the line between concept and spontaneous evolution of opportunities and risks, between suc\u00adcesses and crises. WEA: After the Mexican crisis, G-7 countries discussed the establish\u00adment of crisis-management mecha\u00adnisms. Now, two years later we have the Asian crisis. What do you thin.k should be done to build a new archi\u00adtecture for the international financial system? Trichet: I think there are two very different issues here-the prevention and the healing. And you have to dis\u00adtinguish them. Prevention must be intensified, while keeping in mind that a market economy without risks or crises is unthinkable. Not everything can be regulated. Within the interna\u00adtional financial community, a real con\u00adsensus currently exists and can be seen in work by the IMF, the World Bank, or the Willard Group. Whatever the group, there is a strong agreement on the notion of transparency-in order to function efficiently, high quality infor\u00admation is needed. I think a code of con\u00adduct will gradually be established at the macroeconomic level that is likely to include rules on external debt in for\u00adeign currencies and on the level of the V\u2713ORLD ECONOMIC AffA.r>! e WINTER 1999 immediate. It contrib\u00adutes to the necessary unification of our interconnected world. If you create connections between different econ\u00adomies without linking them to the real economy, and thus have only the finan\u00adcial relationships, then you create a Jess stable world. Another very important part of the emerging consensus is that the sys\u00adtemic nature of banking and insurance systems becomes more and more obvi\u00adous to the world economy. In this con\u00adtext, the work of the Group of 10 is extremely important. Basle Core Prin\u00adciples are vital. There you have an obvi\u00adous consensus on the prevention issues. As regards resolving the crisis, there is clearly no quick fix. Difficulties arise when you deal with external debt held by individual bond\u00adholders. The principle is the same as it Crisis prevention must be intensified, while keeping in mind that a was in the 1980s. The As former President of the Paris Club, I believe that, even if crises are not similar, we can ben\u00adefit from past experi\u00adence. There are some principles that we obvi\u00adously cannot ignore. The first one is that when a crisis erupts, we either manage to seule it in an amicable way, or we don't. Settling a crisis in a co-operative way market economy without- risks application point is dif. ferent since we have now a new problem related to the incredible extent of securitisation and, con\u00adsequently, to the fact that creditors are bond- and stockholders. In the cur\u00adrent system of crisis management, the so called New York or Lon\u00addon Clubs are in charge of co-ordinating the com-or crises is unthinkab/e. means not interrupting the country's payments, not declaring that payments are no longer possible, and not seeing one's signature held away from inter\u00adnational capital markets and from international financial institutions. In many cases, it is possible to settle the 44 mercial banks and the Paris Club is in charge of co-ordinating the governments. But how should we deal with individual bondholders? When ail securities are denominated in local currency and with\u00een the local market, the contribution from external capital holders \u00ees delivered through deprec\u00eea-tion of local currency and depreciationof local securities markets. Internation\u00adal investors therefore face losses throughthe decline of the securities' value. Theessential problem arises with securi_ti\ufffdsdenominated in foreign currency.

That is whenyou have moral haz-ard. Commercial banks must make a significant contribu-tion, not necessarily through capital losses, but possibly through debt reschedulings. The IMF is not a substitute for regular private capital flows. The IMF needs to strengthen its capabil\u00ad;20\u2022 ities for intervention in the world econ\u00adomy and for market development, but I do not believe that the IMF should always intervene. If we do have an opti\u00admum as far as the different actors' con\u00adtributions are concemed, then the role of the IMF is simply to tell what is right in terms of recovery policies. Yet, financing the balance of payments deficit should essentially stay in the hands of the dif\u00adferent creditors involved. Otherwise, you create moral hazard. WEA: Should the IMF warning and surveillance process be made public? Trichet: We have to be prudent. The IMF must be extremely cautious in its warnings. Since public warnings may precipitate a crisis, the IMF must make warnings public only if it thinks that nothing else can be done, and if no eco\u00adnomic policy strategy adjustment from the involved country is expected. If the IMF believes that the crisis can still be avoided and that an adjustment in pol\u00adicy can be obtained voluntarily from the govemment concemed, then an imme\u00addiate public warning is not necessarily the most appropriate tool, and bears the risk of triggering a possibly avoidable crisis. But I strongly recommend warn\u00adings in cases where the IMF assessment is that no policy action is to be expect\u00aded from the country involved. WEA: Do you think the European experience in monetary co-opera\u00adtion can serve as an example for Asian countries? Trichet: You have to beware of analo\u00adgies. The European Monetary Union is linked to European history. There is a very strong weight of history. lt is difficult to find exactly the same relationships in emerging economies. But, the truth is that there are many common elements in these countries' environments at the financial and strategic levels. As suggest\u00aded by contagion effects, international investors, often mistaken-a mistake this was. Now, on the con\u00adtrary, people talk of a super dominant euro. Excess of honour today, excess of indignity yesterday. I believe that the euro, at least during its first years, will follow the same behaviour as its underlying core currencies. What gives the euro its credibility are these European curren\u00adcies-the French Franc, the Deutsche Mark,  the Guilder and some other cur\u00adrencies which consti\u00adtute the foundation of the euro's future cred\u00adibility. Therefore, the first reading on the relationship between the euro and the dollar will be found in the continuity of these European cur\u00adrencies. After a num\u00adber of years, eco\u00adnomic agents will give their judgement according to the sig\u00adnais given by Europe. I believe that the world economy is growing so fast and that the need for financial prod\u00aducts is growing so constantly that there is room for both the dollar and the euro in the world that is taking shape in front of us. It is also ly, tend to group the Asian countries together as ail being the same. I believe the strengthening of co\u00adopera tion between the Asian countries will not necessarily follow a Euro\u00adpean-style mode!. Lessons to be learned from recent events do concern increased local co-opera\u00adtion; but more imi:iortant\u00adly the lessons concem the need for strengthening measures to prevent such crises from happening in the first place. What gives the euro its credibility are these European important for both of these currencies that Eurnpe and the United States share the same economic values. We do not have any strategic disagreements. This is ver:v remarkable. We are in favour of budgets close to equilibrium or in surplus. As for monetary policy objectives, we are also in agreement. Europe must ensure cur\u00adrency stability for non\u00adinflationary growth in the long run. And it is the same in the United States. My experience tells me WEA: What are the international implica\u00adtions of the euro? cu rrencies-the French Franc, the Deutsche Mark, the Gui/der and someother currencies which constitute the foundation of the euro's future credibility. Trichet: There are many different schools of thought. Six months ago, the trend was to predict a weak euro. At that time I explained how fundamental that you only find serious monetary trou\u00adbles when conceptual disagreements exist. Therefore I am confident.
