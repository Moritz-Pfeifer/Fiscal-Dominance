It is the conviction of the ECB Governing Council that the present external value of the euro h?s lost touch with economic fundamentals and does not reflect the favorable conditions existing i\ufffdthe Eurozone. \u00b7;; \u00b7; \u00b7' This opinion is shared by the \"Eurogroup\", that is the group of the eleven finance Ministers olfl). f eurozonc. At the V crsailles meeting, the Eurogroup has fully agreed with the E\ufffdropean . Cert . } :Bank that ''a strong euro is in the interest of Europe\". This short sentence is cci:tai.nly the . st. obvious and the most accurate summary of the position of Europe 11bout the cxtetjial v\ufffdluc o(\ufffdeuro. \u00b7 :\u00b7 1 ' ! 21 The Federal Resen\u2022e .Board participated in the joint action to support the euro. However, the Secretary of the US treaswJ\u2022 has said \u00ab The strong dollar is in the interests of the US \u00bb. Many foreign exchange market traders therefore doubt that the US will intervene to support the e,.,ro again if it dips in value in lhefuture.

In particular, the pace of growth in industrial production appears to havedeclmed somewhat, mid some survey findings also indicate that the pace of activity has been moremo\ufffd\ufffdrate._ However, survey findings remain at h.igh levels and should be bolstered further hypost!tve factors such as strong growth in employment. There is thus good reason to remainconhdent that growth will continue to be sustained in the euro area. Moreover, these developmentstend to strengthen the convergence among member economies. In the case of Gennany, to take theexample_ you re!'errcd to, year-on-year GDP growth was 1.2 percentage point below the curo-\ufffdf.\ufffdaverage m the hrst quarter of 1999. hi the second quarter of 2000, it was only 0.1 percentage pointlower. \u00b7 Jill: . . .!1' 1'9 i 4/ Denmark has held a referendum on the euro. The Danes chose to reject the euro: In the wa#t: JiDenmark's decision, some economists say that the credibility oftlze,euro could be damaged ariUlit could trigger a funherfall in the euro. I What doe.-. Afr Tl'icltet think ah,mt the result of the Danislt referendum? How does lte tltit,k tire foreign exchange market-. will react to the Danish decision in the medium term, not the short\u00adterm? The Eurosystcm has taken note of the decision taken by the Danish electorate in the referendum of 29 September 2000. We acknowledge the decision by the Danish \ufffdleople not to apply for the adoption of the euro as their currency. The Danish authorities are committe.d. to keeping the Danish krone in the European exchange rate mechanism and within the existing narrow bands. Thereby, thp euro will con!inue to -\ufffdcl as the anchor: for monetary policy in D_cnmark, and the result ofi.ti\ufffdreferendum will not affect the co-operation between Danmarks Natlonalbank and the Eurosys,t\ufffdQl.. The foreign exchange markets has taken note of this steady situation. \"i 1,,: I l\ufffdt \u2022 1, ' :itt: 5/ Denmark's rejection of the euro could delay the entry of both 1he UK and Swed\ufffdn. fl could;#it.?\u00b7 c4fect the future expansion of the euro into applicant countries such (f-S' Poland and Hungary. 11 1 I Does Mr-\u00b7 Trichel think that the euro will. be CJ'edible even if tire OK does not choose 'to \u2022 \u2022 I I' f participate ? The euro7.1.me represents an area of 293 million inhabitants and a GDP of ahove 6 100 biHion euroswith a monetary policy based on a stability-oriented strategy, managed by the independent Eurosystem. This strategy ha.<. been understood by financial markets and the public at large : for instance, the yields on long-tenn bonds denominated in curo are clearly indicating that the Eurosystcm already enjoys a significant level of credibility. Moreover, the high level of confiden\ufffde in the curo is guaranteed by the homogeneous functioning of the Eurosystern: all the components <.\ufffdf the Eurosystem - the ECB and the national central banks- work constantly hand in hand, as shown- 'by the 4atest- inWl!Wentions on the foreign exGhange markets.

As to the regulation of securities markets, some decisions are still underway. further harmonization of rules and Cupertino of national authorities contribute to a fully efficient European financial market. 711'he euro-zone governments want to play a bigger role in detenninin!{ poliLyfor the euro qr1\ufffdwant to set inflation targets.for the ECB. .!. \ufffd.-.i \ufffd ..

'This woul\ufffde\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7against the Treaty, against the Eurosystem's independence and in contradiction with the practice and the national laws in effect before Monetary Union. The sharirig of tasks established by 'itie Treaty is very clear : the independent Eurosystem defines and implements the monetary policy of the curo area and conducts foreign exchange operations. Concerning the latter, the Council may, acting unanimously on a recommendation from the ECB or from the Commission, conclude fom1al agreements on an exchange rate system. Tn absence of an exchange rate system -i.11 the floating system experienced at present by the ma.in world currencies-, the Council may formulate, in exceptional circumstances, general orientations. In this context, the Treaty granls the Eurosystem the exclusive competence of conducting foreign exchange operations, without prejudice of its ultimate objective of price stahility. .H 8/ The Bank of Japan recenrly abandoned its 'zero interest' policy and raised interest ratcs.11,hy Japanese politicians criticized this change because the Japanese economy is still in the early st of recovery. . : . :\ufffd.\u00b7 \ufffd.
