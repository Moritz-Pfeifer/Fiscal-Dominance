LE GOUVERNEUR PAR LE JOURNAL JAPONAIS MAINICHI l / Joint intervention in the foreign exchange markets by the ECB, .FED and rhe Bank of.lapan has d<'fended the euro against farther depreciation. However, the euro is sti/L hovering near ft.\u00e7 lowe.srleve/ at tmder .90 cents. Sorne market participants have said thai rhe intervention will on/y have a temporary \ufffd\u00e8ct ant that in the medium term the euro willfail again. How t\u00dbJe.,\u00b7 Mr Trichet .'iee the eurn'.<1/uture and df1es he think that the ECB will be able to ensure that the euro rec,wers? lt is the conviction of the \u00ebCB Goveming Council that the present externaJ value of the euro docs not rcflect the econoinic fondamentals of the Eurozone. We consider, with our President Wim Duisenberg, that a strong euro is in the interest of Europe. This view is shared by all membcrs of the Govcrning CounciL lt sums up our position. 2/ The Federal Reserve Board participated in the joint action to support the euro. Hawever, the Secretary of the US treasury has said \u00ab The sb\u00b7ong dollar is in the interests of the US\u00bb. Many foreign exchange market traders therejore doubt that the US wifl intervene to support the euro again if i t dips in valtte in the future. Does Mr Trichet t/iink that the cooperative structure ,,f the G7 countries will f unction to support the euro again if intervention is once more required in the future ? ln this mattcr, wc only need to refer lo the prccisc terms of the communiqu\u00e9 issued by the G7 countries in last September in Prag: the G7 countries stated thal Lhey \u00ab have a shared interest in a strong and stable international monctary system : at the initiative of the Eun)pean Central Bank, the monetary authorities of the United States, Japan, United Kingdom and Canada joincd with the European Central Bank on Friday, September 22, in concerted intervention in cxchangc markets, because of the sharcd concern of finance Ministers and Govcrnors about the potential implications of recent movements in the euro for the world economy \u00bb. This communiqu\u00e9 speaks hy itself an<l there is nothing to add to it. 3/ Mr Trichet lias pointed out thatfactors such as higher oil prices are pushing up the inflation rate in the euro zone. flowever, some economic figures show that German economic growth is slowing and German officiais argue that any interest rate hike wi/1, in .fact, prove to be an obstacle to sustainable growth in the euro zone. What does Mr Tr\u00eechet think about the argument put forward by these German officiais ? 1 have never seen any such statemcnt of \"officiais\" anywhere in :Eurnpe. In any case wc have to take accoullt of the full body of the 300 million inhabitants of the Euro:.conc.

In the wake ofDenrnark's decision, some economLrts say that the crcchh,bly 0/ the euro could be damagc:d and itcould lrigger a.furtlzer j\u00e0/1 in the euro. W hat tkJe\ufffd\u00b7 Mr Trichet think about the result of the Danish referendum ? How does he think the /oreign exchange markets will react to the Danish d\u00e8ci,don in the medium term, not the short\u00adterm ? The :Eurosystem has taken notti of the decision taken by the Danish eiectorate \ufffdn the referendum of29 Septemher 2000. Simultaneously the Danish authorities are _fu\ufffdly comm.1tt\ufffdd to keeping theDa nish knme in the European exchange rate mechanism and w1thm the exi\ufffdt1\ufffd1 \ufffd narrow bands. Therehy, the result of the reforendum will not affect the very close and rruitfol co-opera tion between Danmarks Nationalbank and the Eurosystcm. 5/ Den mark 's rejection of the euro could delay the entry of both t he UK and Swedcm. Tt cou/d also affect the fature expansion of the euro into ap plicant countries such as Po land and Hunga,y. Doe.t Mr Tricliet think that the euro will be credible even if the UK does noc choo.ve to participate ? Without the UK, the eurozone represents an arca of 293 million i.nhabitants today, and 304 million within a month when Greece will join in, with a monetary policy ba sed on a stability-oriented struteg y, managed by the indcpcndcnt Eurosystem. This represents a major economic area whose single market with a single currency is particularly promising and is alrcady a grcat suceess. As regards the UJ<, Sweden and Dcnmark, l would Hke to stress that these countries are unanimously and warmly welcome in the euro area. lt is up to them to decide ... 6/ The .Euro-zone governments, especially the French government,, insist that the Euro-zone must have a harmonized.financia/ regulation system. Does Mr. Trichet tbink tbat thi.,; idea could work or will it rai.-.e fear.<, among smal/ countries that they will lm\u0153 their financial sovereignty ? European finaneial systems have already accomplished imprcssivc progrcss towards more integrated and efficient structures. Conceming the regulatory area, harmonization in the basis of a decentrnlized system is certainly the key. The authorities seek to further enhanee the operation of the single market p.rinciples, in line with the Financial Action Plan and with the principlc of subsidiarity. l am firmly convinecd that strengthened co-operation bctween all i.nterested national authorities isthe right tool for enhanci.ng the degree of integration of European financial systems. The Report onFinancial Stability adopted this year by the Economie and .Financial Committee (an advisory bodyof the .ECOFIN Council) indicatcd that, to deal with an increa\ufffdingly integrated Europcan financialmarket, present institutional arrangements based on national competence and co-opcration arcadequate provided co-operation between national authorities is strengthencd.71 The euro-zone governments want to play a bigger raie in determining policy /or the euro andwant to set inflation targets for the ECB. Does Mr .Trichet tbink tllat thi.f could lead to serious friction devefopillK between governments andtheECB? E\ufffdr\ufffd-zone govemments have nevcr expres\ufffded such views to set inflation targcts. Therc is no\ufffdlchon at all between govt::mm\ufffdnts _and the mdcpendant ECB. In any case the treaty or Maastrichtts very cl\ufffdar and guarantees the full mdependance of the Euro system.-2 Fax re\u00e7u de 0142924411 BDF DGEI ADJOINTS 01/12/00 17:57 Pg: 4 8/ The Bank of Japan recenlly abandaned its 'zero interest' po/icy and raiscd interest rates. Many .lapanese politicians criticized this change because the Japanese economy is still in the early stages ofrecovery. Does Mr Trichet th1'nk that the BOJ-'s monetary polic_v i.'i correct or <uJe!i he think that the decision to raise interest rates was taken too early'/ Tht: Bank of Japan is an independent institution. It is an experienced and wise institution that.is better than any other body in the position to assess the Japanese monetary and economic context and to choose the righl time to act. It has a long st.1nding tradition of wisdom and I have no doubt thai the-decision it has taken has bccn carcfully draftcd. 3 ", "published_date": "2000-01-12", "section": "interview"}
