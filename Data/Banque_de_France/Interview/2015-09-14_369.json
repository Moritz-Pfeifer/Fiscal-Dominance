I would first of all like to express the great pleasure I have to open this \nconference for the twentieth anniversary of the Banque de France Foundation for Monetary, \nbanking and financial economic research.  \nI welcome the prominent speakers who made us the honor of joining us today \u2013 Yann Algan \nfrom Sciences Po in Paris and Luigi Zingales from the University of Chicago Booth School of \nBusiness \u2013 and all our chairs and discussants who also are renowned economists in their \nrespective fields. \nA few words about the topic of this conference now. The idea of this conference is to take a \nstep back and some time to reflect on monetary and financial research in general, and its \nimpact on policies and society. We will thus evoke the role of economics and economists \nwithin our society.  \nThe two provocative papers discussed today provide a very nice opportunity for such a \ndiscussion. They both point out several concerns about economic research and finance. \nThey highlight the tendencies of economists to be self-referential and analyze how the social \nperception of the finance industry is largely negative nowadays, and the more so since the \nfinancial crisis. In that respect, the paper focuses on the United States, but there is little \ndoubt that France probably is no exception to that rule either.  \n \n2 \n \nAfter the 2007-2008 crisis, some first steps have been taken to change incentives in the \nfinancial industry. And even more should be done in that direction in the coming years. At the \nsame time, economists should also adopt a more critical view on the financial industry \npractices and judge them as impartially as possible.  \nBut what can we say about economists themselves? Are they really too self-referential and \ndo they tend to overestimate their role in society? On a personal note \u2013 as a policymaker and \ncentral banker \u2013 I do believe it is possible that central bank governors may pay the cost of \nthe so-called \u201csuperiority\u201d of economists (for instance when they are too sure of their \neconometric models). \nHow will we proceed in this conference today? In-depth discussion of papers will be left to \nparticipants. However, I would like to mention the potential role that the Foundation can play \nto help address some important issues.  \nFirst, economic analysis is definitely needed in order to sharpen policy makers\u2019 \nunderstanding of the world. At the same time, policy makers should continuously challenge \nthe alleged \u201csuperiority\u201d of economists with the complexity of the real world.  \nSecond, actions need to be taken to get academia more involved in policymaking, to bring \nthe discipline of theory-based analyses to the policy debates. That implies a better access to \ngovernmental data for academic researchers, to enable them to conduct independent and \nrigorous research and expose their results to policymakers and the general public, who \nshould listen to them in return.  \nWell, I hope this is no wishful thinking and I will now leave the floor to our distinguished \nspeakers. Thank you. \n***** \nClosing Speech by Christian Noyer, Governor of the Banque de France \nTo close today\u2019s conference, I would like to come back to the Foundation and its role. I will \nfocus on a brief historical overview of the Foundation for Monetary, banking and financial \neconomic research. A lot has been achieved since 1995, as you know. What was our goal? \nTo promote excellence in academic research in the field of monetary policy and finance.  \nAnd did we achieve it so far? \n \n3 \n \nWell, over three hundred conferences and seminars have been sponsored. The research \ngrant program has also awarded 81 grants for about 2.4 million euros in total. While it is \ndifficult to identify the potential outcome of projects at an early stage, the program has been \nrewarded by excellent outcomes. Most papers were published in the best international \nresearch journals. \nYet not just academic successes were achieved. Some papers were also financed by the \nFoundation and later became hot policy topics, sometimes with very good insight. For \ninstance, I think of a paper by Freixas, Parigi and Rochet on \u201cSystemic Risk, Interbank \nRelationships and Liquidity Provision by the Central Bank\u201d published in 2000 in the Journal of \nMoney, Credit and Banking (JMCB). In 2000, that is eight years before the crisis. And yet the \npaper already underlined the importance of interbank relationships in the spread of risk. \nSome trends and evolutions in research in economics and in the work of central banks over \nthe last twenty years were also identified and discussed. Obviously globalization and \ninternational links have played an ever more important role in monetary and financial \neconomics (including with the creation of the euro for instance). There were also changes in \neconomic research, as more attention was progressively given to actual policy-making. One \nof the leading examples is perhaps the so-called Taylor rule, which was created to describe \nthe actual behavior of central bankers. This allowed a much richer interaction between \nacademia and policy makers.  \nChanges also affected policy-making, with more attention paid to academic debates. These \neven influenced the very structure of central banks. Research units were put into place and \ndeveloped in most major central banks, including the Banque de France, which also \nimplemented an External Evaluation of Research (EER). Central bankers indeed realized the \nimportance of conducting their own research activities to support policy making. Heavier use \nof theoretical findings and data-based analysis was made, in order for central banks to better \narticulate their policy actions.  \nAlso, economic research outside central banks \u2013 which is not driven by direct \u201cdaily\u201d topics \u2013 \nproved ultimately valuable for policy too. For example, some ideas developed in Krugman \n(1998) and Eggertson & Woodford (2003) on policy at the Zero Lower Bound, inspired by the \neconomic stagnation in Japan, entered the United States and Euro Area policy debates \nyears after their publication. \nThe Banque de France Foundation has accompanied all these significant trends. By \nfostering research conducted by international teams. By sponsoring research unrelated to \n \n4 \n \nimmediate Banque de France needs, but which would ultimately prove beneficial for our \npolicies. In that respect, I do expect that the Foundation will still play an important role in the \nnext decade in promoting excellence in research in the field of monetary and financial \neconomics. I also hope \u2013 and this will be my conclusion \u2013 that this is no wishful thinking \neither.  \nOnce again, let me thank all the participants, speakers, discussants and chairs that have \njoined us today for such fruitful talks and congratulate the young researchers who received a \nwell-deserved prize for their work. A special thanks also to all the actors of the Foundation, \nwhose constant help and dedication to their missions are precious and appreciated. Now is \ntime to have lunch and I believe a buffet has been prepared. Thank you. \n \n \n \n \n", "published_date": "2015-09-14", "section": "interview"}
