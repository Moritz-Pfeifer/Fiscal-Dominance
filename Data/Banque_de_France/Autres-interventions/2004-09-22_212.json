Where do we stand? My answer is threefold. \u2022 GDP growth is still on a sustained path on the exports markets of the euro area,mainly in the United States and Asia, although its pace was slower in Q2 2004 than inthe previous quarters.\u2022 In the euro area, growth is picking up with some lag and at a lower pace than in otherindustrial countries, against the background of a solid external demand. Economicactiv ity is more vigorous in France than it is elsewhere in the Euro area, due to arelatively strong domestic demand.\u2022 Overall, undue pessimism is not warranted. But du\ufffd attention should be paid to therisks attached to increased inflationary pressures and ballooning global imbalances,which call for appropriate policy actions.-/\u00b7 / ' Growth is solid in all major export markets of the euro area United States \u2022 In the US, the recovery is now well underway. Growth was strong in 2003, standingat 3.1 % on average. It was supported by a sustained increase in domestic demand andfrom the second semester up, a pick up in exports following the dollar's depreciation.In Ql 2o'o4, GDP recorded a q-o-q 1.0% increase as in the previous quarter, mainlydriven by domestic demand. Yet, GDP growth decelerated somehow in Q2 2004, at0.7% q-o-q, following a lower contribution of private consumption. Indeed, labourincome has so far not relayed tax cuts in supporting domestic demand. While thecurrent high pace of productivity can naturally be seen as an asset for the USeconomy, we must acknowledge that these gains have so far not resulted in a strongacceleration of real wages: indeed, average real weekly wages have only increased by0.4% y-o-y in August 2004, after -0.3% in July 2004.\u2022 Even after this slight slowing down, the US economy growth remains quite strong. Itmay even be considered as more solid, that is more sustainable in the long ru n, thanbefore. Moreover, recent leading indicators of economic activity tend to show thatgrowth would remain solid from Q3 2004 onwards. On the one hand, consumerspending will be hampered by a less stimulating policy than in 2001 and 2002. On theother hand, business investment would continue to be fuelled by improved corporatebalance sheets and increased profits. Corporate profivi to GDP ratios have now comeback to the level they reached in 2000.\u2022 In Japan, the initially export-led recovery has broadened its base, with a steadyincrease in business investment since Q2 2002 and consumer price deflationarypressures abating somewhat. Furthermore, private consumption has picked up over2 the last summer, following the rebound observed in personal disposable income and firmer GDP growth in the US would help in strengthening economic activity. \u2022 The recovery may be blocked at some point by the persisting difficulties in thefinancial system's situation and growing imbalances in the general government sector.In August 2004, bank loans were still decreasing at y-o-y rates close to 3%.United Kingdom \u2022 In the UK, increased private consumption, government spending and a boominghousing market have supported GDP growth. While business investment hasaccelerated in the recent past, the relatively high level of corporate indebtednesscombined with a downward trend in share prices may trigger balance sheetrestructuring and a lower growth rate for capital spending than in the previous cycle.Emerging areas \u2022 Non Japan-Asia (including China and India) continues to record stellar growth rates,reflecting both vigorous e\ufffdort flows and the persistence of a process of internaldemand broadening in Asia. In Eastern Europe, growth is also and would remainvery robust, against the background of continuing direct investment flows.The situation is also improving in the Euro area, although to a lesser degree Euro area \u2022 National accounts figures relating to the first two quarters of 2004 have been moreencouraging than in the previous quarters, although the recovery is still modestcompared to other major economic areas. GDP grew only by 0.4% in 2003, butposted a y-o-y 2.0% growth in Q2 2004 after 1.3% in Ql 2004, this acceleration3 /\u00b7 mainly reflecting stronger external demand and stock building. At the current juncture, PMI indices for both the manufacturing and services sectors have remained for more than one year above the level signalling an expansion of economic activ:ity. \u2022 Yet, the Euro area is still over-dependent on external demand: net exports explaind1e four fifths of the overall 0.5% GDP increase recorded in Q2 2004. n average,domestic demand shows no clear sign of recovery. In some respect, this delay reflectsslower employment growth in Europe, with the unemployment rate at its peak sinceJanuary 2004 (9%), which weighs on personal disposal income and thereforedomestic demand. In Germany, namely, this could be linked to the efforts made byfirms to offset past losses in competitiveness, which imply maintaining a downwardpressure on employment and wages. Besides, the necessary structural reforms that arebeing implemented to contain health care expenditure and increase flexibility on thelabour market may have short-term adverse consequences on consumption spending.\u2022 In this context, France, where domestic demand has been transitorily boosted bypublic consumption and one-off measures in favour of consumption, remains anexception. GDP growth, fuelled by a relatively strong domestic demand, stood at1. 7% and 3.0% y-o-y in the two first quarters of 2004, with a carry-over for the wholeof 2004 at 2.1 %. The contribution of private consumption to y-o-y GDP growth went from 1 point in Ql 2004 to 1.5 point in Q2)004. The conditions of public consumption reached 0.8 point in Q2 2004, after 0.6 point in the previous quarter. \u2022 The business climate indicator calculated by the Banque de France posted 104 in Julyafter 106 in June and 93 one year earlier. GDP is expected to grow by 0.6% in Q32004 after 0.8% in Q2 2004. That means that growth in France will reach at least2.5% in 2004, maybe more.4 Nevertheless, due attention should be paid to the risks attached to increased inflationary pressures and ballooning global imbalances Inflationary pressures \u2022 Increased inflationary pressures may arise from a situation where GDP growth wouldstand above potential in the United States and Japan in 2004 and to a lesser extent in2005-2006, with output gaps closing by then, according to most internationalforecasters. In the euro area, the HICP has recently picked up above 2% followingincreased oil and commodity prices. Furthermore, perceived inflation remainsrelatively high, in the neighbourhood of 4%.\u2022 In my view, the impact of the recent surge must not be overstated as in real termstoday's price (USD 40 per barrel) is far below the levels reached in the early 80s(about USD 70 relatively to the US CPI). In addition, oil stands today for a lowershare of energy consumption in OECD countries than it used to be ( 40% againstmore than 50% in the early 70s). And let me add, to take a French example, that theglobal cost of imported energy will approximately account for less than 1. 7% of GDPin 2004 after 1.5% in 2003, \ufffdhich is far less than the 1981 ratio (5%).\u2022 Nevertheless, anchoring price expectations is more than ever a key to any recoveryand it must be clear for the general public that we pay due attention to possiblesecond round effects which could arise from persistently high oil prices, inconnection with the degree and the type of wage indexation.Global imbalances \u2022 The US economy is recording a ballooning current account deficit (5. 7% of GDP inQ2 2004), meaning that growth in the US is significantly financed by the savings of5 the rest of the world, including emerging and transition countries whose catching-up process requires strong capital inflows. \u2022 But, a reversal of capital flows to the US is now a distinct possibility because anincreasing share of the external deficit is financed by non-resident purchases of USgovernment securities (from 20% of total net capital inflows in 2002 to 33% in 2003),which are more easily transferable than foreign direct investments. Furthermore, thefinancing of the US current account deficit largely rests on Asian investors,particularly Asian central banks, which makes their investment strategy crucial to itssustainability. Finally, it is debatable whether the return on capital is structurallyhigher in the US than in the rest of the world and will remain so.\u2022 A lowering of capital inflows to the US could trigger an excessive depreciation of thedollar and/ or an abrupt rise in interest rates with spillover effects on other financialmarkets, should non-residents investors demand an increasing premium for holdingdollar-denominated assets. In the light of these risks of disruption, a move towardsre-balancing the US current account is clearly warranted.Policy responses \u2022 In theory, current account deficits can be reverted through adjustments in exchangerates and/ or growth differentials. Past experience and econometric simulationsillustrate that a reduction in growth differentials between the US and their tradingpartners would be much more efficient to curb the US current account deficit than adollar exchange rate depreciation.\u2022 In this regard, a less accommodative stance of the US policy mix, aiming at bringingpublic finances on a prudent medium run path and favouring a gradual revival ofdomestic savings, is clearly warranted for a sustained reduction of the current accountdeficit.6 \u2022 Nevertheless, member states of the euro area, and perhaps more specifically Franceand Germany, have a lot to do to foster economic growth through an acceleration ofstructural reforms aimed at raising productivity, improving the efficiency of publicservices and reducing deficits.\u2022 Euro area governments have made substantial progress over the past few years inimplementing structural policy reforms in product and labour markets in order toraise the productive and job-creating potential of their economies, to increase theirresilience to shocks and to underpin business and consumer confidence. They should,however, continue to implement in a determined way structural reforms, notably asregards products markets, trade liberalisation in services and a better functioning oflabour markets.\u2022 In particular, the areas in which further progress is needed are well identified, and acertain number of Member States are already tackling the reforms to be made in theseareas. I can review some of them:- accelerating the liberalis\ufffdtion of the network industries;further eliminating remauung barriers to trade entry; further improving the efficiency and mobility of the labour markets by making tax and benefit systems more employment-friendly for instance; encouraging entrepreneurship by improving and simplifying the corporate tax system and regulatory environment and pressing forward the harmonisation of accounting standards and value added and business taxation among the different member economies; and, finally, increasing the European Union's research and development spending. 7 Conclusion \u2022 Notwithstanding the risks and imbalances mentioned above, I remain cautiouslyconfident on both economic and .financial prospects. The continuous decrease in unitlabour costs registered in the US in the recent past (-0.3 % y-o-y at the end of Q22004) should contribute to restoring corporate profitability, business investment andtherefore the net demand addressed by the US to the rest of the world.\u2022 Meanwhile, Japan would continue to press forward with structural reforms toaccelerate the removal of bad loans from balance sheets and restore profitability inboth the banking and the corporate sectors.\u2022 Finally, efforts in the Euro area to foster productivity gains should help reduceinflationary pressures. If inflation decelerates, the resulting increase in real wageswould support private consumption and investment prospects.8 ", "published_date": "2004-09-22", "section": "autres-interventions"}
