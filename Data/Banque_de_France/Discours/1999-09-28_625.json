The euro was bom and the irreversible nature of this change has convinced an increasing number of political and economic actors that the success of the ew-o is a necessity for Europe. lt is a keystone of the European single market which will ensure prosperity in Europe for the benefit of the rest of the world. 11, ..,. It is clear that, now and for the future, we have to face a number of challenges to make this success sustainable. I would like today to draw your attention particularly to the following two issues \u25a0 First, the Europeans have to meet certain conditions for the euro tobe a full success; \u25a0 Second, the euro will make an important contribution towardsencouraging a balanced international monetary situation. \u2022\"\" \u2022\"sEP\ufffd2s-1999 10:07 P.03\ufffd43 ' II THE SUCCESS OF THE EURO WILL BE COMPLETE IF A Nl]MBER OF CHALLENGES ARE TAKEN UP The successful introduction of the euro is, in itself, a major refonn. But it will be fruitful only if a. certain number of conditions are met, above and beyond monetary policy, in particular regarding structural reforms. A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of sceptical people, in Europe but, especially, herein the US, that the euro was a viable \" project. Many people pointed to its presumed contradictions, and i\ufffds alleged inconsistencies: for example, the impossibility of achieving an efficient policy mix without a political federation; the impossibility of avoiding some \"asymetric shocks\" (th.at is to say difficulties occurring in a Member economy and not in others); the lack of sufficient flexibility ofthe economy and real mobility of the labour force in the European countries etc .. , The conclusion was that the euro would never exist! (\ufffd Facts have refuted these criticisms. But they are useful to help answer th.e question of what are the conditions for ensuring that the euro is a complete success. I see four ca_nditions:-The first condition is the credibility of monetaQ:'. policy guaranteed by theindependence of the European Central Bank, which is enshrined in theMaastricht Treaty and rooted in the independence of each national centralbank. If the euro is to be a credible currency, it must win the con.fidence ofthe 290 million Europeans in the euro area and also the confidence of non-. .

This can only be ensured by resisting any kind of pressure, including political, on how the new currency is managed. The necessary dialogue between monetary policy officials and economic policy officials must tak.e the independence of the ESCB into account and also the objective of price stability which, according to the Treaty, must guide the rnonetary policy of the euro area. The respect for the independence of the monetary policy is a condition for the success of the \" euro, in particular in the framework of the ''Cologne \ufffdrocess\"\u00admacroeconomic dialogue for the implementation of !he employment Pact\u00adadopted at the last European Council. r. Satisfying this first conclition related to the credibility and the independence ofthe monetary policy, will be facilitated by the harmonious functioning of the European monetary team, which is composed of the ECB and the national central banks from the eleven founding countries. -The second condition is compliance with the provisions of the Treaty andthe guidelines laid down in the Sta\ufffdility and Growth Pact with regard tofiscal policy. Close coordination of fiscal policies and vigilant peersurveillance within the informal council of the eleven participating memberstates - the \"Euro Eleven Club\"- and by the ministers of finance of the 15Member States convened in the Ecofin Council is essential to ensure abalanced policy mix throughout the eurozone. The medium-term objectiveof achieving \" public finances that are close to balance or in surplus\" -meansnobody gets to run a selfish budget deficit. To comply with this objective isregu. de - - -Fa>< gu. ae \u2022 ._ .. c.,\u00b7 .., . .,,,-.d 1\ufffd:5z J:'g: 6/.L\u00b7a- i- 1\ufffd, .\u2022. ._. .Jt' :r:1 .J.;:) \u2022 ;:)G, C!:J \u00b7 =>,.- .L\ufffd.l ., p_O,F;/1,.d ,-a>< re5EP-2s-1999 10: 08 \u2022 5 indispensable for the union as a whole to weather periods of economic difficulty an.d for individual countries to withstand possible economic downtums which affect only their own economy. lt is the adhesion of all the European governments to the Stability and Growth Pact that allowed the nationai central banks, and the GovemingCouncil of the ECB to decide, last April, to lower the ECB's key interest rates from 3% to 2.5%, in order to provide the euro area with extremely favourable monetary conditions . We have to understand that monetary policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overall level of the Economic an.d Monetary Union. For my part, I would give tbree economic justi:fications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact. - First, by coordinating the fiscal policies of the Member States of MonetaryUnion, the pact ensures a good policy mix within the euro area. This is(' essential for monetary policy. Since Europe does not have a significantfederal budget, just as it has no federal govemment, the sum of the nationalbudgets must serve as an overall budget for the area as a whole. This callsfor close mutual surveillance and coordination of fiscal policies within thearea.' P.05/i4\u00b71 u de: fai< \"8\u00a7EP_29-1999 10: 09g: bl .1.\u00b7a P.06/14' e _ Then, the pact helps prevent well-run economies from having to bear unjustified risk premia by setting up a system of penalties for excessive deficits. - Finally, the stability pact allows us to disprove the assertion that the euroarea has no automatic stabilizers in the event of asymetric shocks to amember economy. Indeed, by urging govemments to aim for a fiscalposition of close to balance or in surplus in the medium term, the pactenables them to let :fiscal deficits increase during recessions without\ufffd exceeding the 3% reference value. In short, it allows them to creat\ufffd a :fiscalbuffer during nonnal economic periods that can be drawn on, if anasymetric sbock occurs.-The third condition is that all European countries must resolutelyundertake structural reforms. Continental Europe is experiencing too highlevels of unemployment, despite the fact that the jobless rate has beendeclining slightly in most of its econo.mies. According to the IMF and theOECD, around 80% ofthis unemployment is structural, that is, generated byour own burdensome rules and regulations. The Monetary Policy Council ofthe Banque de France agrees with this analysis.Just recently, some extemal observers were still reproaching Europe to focus its efforts and political energy on the euro, instead of implementing the structural reforms necessary for more dynamic j ob creation. These critics were wrang regarding the untimeliness of the euro, but their assessment of the problems of the European economy is obviously correct. ., P.07/147 \u2022 The euro will complement, rather than detract from, structural reforms.Most importantly, a single currency will ease the flow of goods, servicesand capital within the eurozone. And the euro will also encourage \"crossfertilization\" \u00b7 of best practices through stronger coordination of memberstates policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, workand job creation incentives, effective \ufffd.,elfare safety nets, etc . .It is the reasonwhy European Council meeting in Luxemburg has decided to take thisnecessity into account and has explicitly mentioned structural policiesamong the items selected for reinforced coordination.-Tbe fourth condition is that all economic leaders in Europe must \ufffdeclearsighted with regard to the crucial question of competitiveness. Pre-euroeconomic policy meant monitoring trade balances, the balance of paymentsand the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. Authorities thusreceived constant feedback on key indicators affecting national economicperformance and could react accordingly. These indicators were sensible,multiple and very reactive.Most of these indicators have disappeared at the national level or have seen their significance weakened, with the advent of the euro. But, of course, they remain on the euro-wide level. This is why the coordination of fiscal and economic policy provided for by the Treaty is so important. Nevertheless, the rules of a market economy, especially competition, continue to apply to each economy. Jobs are created by consumers when they choose the goods and services they feel are the best value for money. 8 Businessmen allocate these jobs to various possible locations in various countries according to the relative competitiveness of these locations. The leaders of each national economy must therefore monitor competitivenesseven more closely than before through indicators such as unit production costs, companies investments, and the tax and regulatory framework. Contrary to the pre-euro period, loss of competitiveness will not show up so quickly on radar screens like extemal accounts and foreign exchange markets, so economic managers must be even more vigilant in watching r other indicators. The sanctions for economic policy errors might come more slowly and insidiously via rising unemployment and weak growth. II/ THE SUCCESS OF THE EURO WILL YIELD A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO A BETTER ECONOMIC AND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN THE WORLD. In the current overall economic situation, the success of the euro will greatly help both Europe and the rest of the world which will benefit from European prosperity and growth as part of a health.y world economy. Clearly, the new monetary setting in Europe has, and will have, far-reaching consequences not only for Europe and its people, but also for the world economy and the international community. Tue Euro area contribution to international stability may be appreciated through the development of balanced economic relationships inside the euro fl area and with the countries out\ufffdide the European Union, and through thereinforcement of international financial and monetary stability.EMU will help to set balanced economic relationships. The relationsbip between monetary union and the other European countries will be based on coordination. Coordination of the economic policies of the 15 countries of the European Community .is required by the Treaty. lt is necessary for the European Union to function properly at the economic level. lt is important that the dialogue b\ufffdtween all EU countries continues, even though the changeover to the euro modifies the traditional economic environment of the European Union. In particular, the coordination between the 15 countries will allow the countries that have not yet joined monetary union to converge towards the euro area. The new exchange\ufffdrate mechanism that links, to the euro, some of the currencies concemed (this is the case of the Greek drachma and the rt Danish krone since January Ist 1999) will play its part in this process. By promoting exchan.ge\ufffdrate stability, the new ERM will ensure that the single market operates smoothly and will help the \"out\" countries to qualify for the single currency. t The Monetary Union will also have close relationships with countries outside the European Union. 10 :, p,10/14 f \u00b7 First, the monetary union and the European Union will be an attractive polefor our neighbours from central Europe. The results achieved by some ofthem during the last years show remarkable improvements. They must keepon making an effort to be able to join EMU in fitting conditions, which is intheir own interest and in the interest of current EU \ufffdember states.With regard to international cooperation, the Euro area will also play a key role. lt represents an area of stability and sustainable economic growth for some 290 millions inhabitants, and it will definitely have a major influence in the international community. Tue euro will make the international economic cooperation process easier between the main partners - the United States, Japan, and the Euro area. Bach of them is in a position to speak on behalf of a }arge economic area. Moreover, each partner is vulnerable to a rather similar degree to adverse shocks occurring in the international financial system. * * In conclusion, let me stress four points, taking stock ofthe meetings I participated in during the last three days. \u2022l P.11/1411 1/ Firstly1 the global economy is doing much better than a year ago, which is the best demon_stration of an appropriate handling of thedifficult situation in which we were in September 1998. W orld output growing at a pace of 3% in 1999 and 3 \u00bd% in 2000 is pretty encouraging.particularly striking is the fact that the newly industrialized Asian economies are likely to grow at a pace of a little more than 5%, both in 1999 andin 2000. This cails for two \"coups de chapeaun : one to the Asian economies themselves which have demonstrated a remarkable capacity to adjust in a very short span of time. The second to the IFis, and in particular the IMF end the World Bank, which have demonstrated in the most difficult circumstances lucidity, determination and courage. I know that saying that is not fashionable. But it is precisely because it is not fashionable that it is worth saying it. 2/ Secondly. this is not the time for complacency. The global economy is in much better shape but remains fragile, taking into account the risks and the challenges that exist, facing the international community. We 12 111ust demonstrate that we, in the industrialized world, can take advantage of a quieter and calmer period to embark rapidly on the reforms that are needed. Amongst the reforms, I would like to emphasize particularly the necessity: - to foster structural reforms in Europe in order to consolidate theEuropean economy and to combat unemployment;- to improve the level of households savings in the US economv inorder to help alleviate the extemal imbalances that are currentlyobserved;- and to continue to reshape the Japanese economy througha12propriate and bald restructuring in the industry.3/ Thirdly, I am encouraged by a number of orientations that have been pragmatically adopted herein Washington in the recent days. I 13 see in particular three elements that are of great importance in my personal view: - the declaration of the G7 on tbe yen, which isJmportant because itcristallizes the consensus of the major industrialized countries in asimple and clear fashion. In my memory, markets have neverneglected such signals of the 07, which are given onlyexceptionally.- the statement on golg, underwritten by 15 central banks includingBanque de France, which states that gold will remain an importantelement of global monetary reserves.- And, last but not least, the solution given to the Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries initiative which demonstrates that the internationalcommunity is mobilizing, through all possible channels,appropriate financing to help the poorest overcome theirdifficulties.14 4/ And fourthly, the strategic stance which seems to me the most appropriate conceming the Eurosystem could be summed up with the two keY words of confidence and vigilance, expressed by our President. Con:fidence in our currency, in its solidity, andin a non-inflationary and sound evolution of the European economy, which is displaying very encouraging sigris all over Europe and particularly in France. And at the same time, vigilance, because a central bank must never relax its vigilant stance -it is like driving a car, when everything is all right, the driver must not, even for a .minute, stop paying attention-, \u00b7because \ufffdevelopmeil,ts in the real econo\ufffdy as well as in the monetary and financial fields have to be scrutinized very carefully in the present period, and because structural reforms are more than ever crucial in the euro area.
