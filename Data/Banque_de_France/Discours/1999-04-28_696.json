Th: euro \ufffd bom and th\ufffd. irreversible nature of this change hasnvinced an mcreasmg number of political and economic actors that the 5111ccess:\ufffd the euro is a. necessity for E\ufffdop\ufffd. lt is a keystone of thc European single rnarket which will ensure prospenty tn Europe. It is clear tbat, now and for the future, we havc to face a numbcr of challenses to make this success sustamable. I would like today to draw yourattention particularly to the following two issues First, the euro area will have to face up to a number of challenges to confumits initial success (I); Second, the success of the euro will make a major contribution towards encouraging a more balanced international monetary situation (ll). 1/ THE SUCCESS OF TBE EURO WILL BE COMPLETE IF A NUMBER OF CUALLENGES ARE TAKEN UP A few years ago. it was necessary to convince a great number of skepti.c people, in Europe but, especially, here in the US, that the euro ... vas a viable proj ect. Many people pointed to its presumed contradictions and its alleged inconsistencies: for example, the impossibility of achieving an efficient policy mix 'ithout a political federation; the impossibility of avoiding some 11a.'i)'Il1IIletric shocks\" (that is to say difficulti.es occurring in a Member economy and not in others ); the lack of sufficient flexibility of the economy and real mobility of the labour force in the European countries, etc ... The conclusion was that the euro would never ex.ist! Facts have refuted these criticisms. But they are usef\u00fcl to help answer the guestion of what are the conditions for ensuring that the ew:o is a complete success. I see four conditions: -Tbe flrst condition is the creclibility of monetary policy guaranteed bv theW.dependence of the European Central Bank, which is enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty and rooted in the independence of each national central bank. Tue euro is a credible currency and it must an\u00e4 will carefully keep and consolidate the confidence of the 290 million Europeans in the euro area and tb.e confidence of non-Emopeans with wbom we do business. Th.is can only be en.smed by res;sting any kind of pressure on how the new currency is managed. Satisfying tbis first condition will be facilitated, by the hannonious functioning of the European monetaxy tearn, which iscomposed of the ECB and the elcven national central banks of the Euro area.-The second coodition is compliaoce with the provisions of the Treaty and theguidelines l\ufffdd \ufffdown \ufffd the Stabil\ufffd\ufffd and Oro\ufffd Pact with regard to nscal policy.Close coordination ot fiscal polic1es and Vlgilant peer surveillancc within theinformal council of the cleven. participating member states - tb.c so-called \"EuroEleven\"\u00b7 and by the m.inisters offinancc ofthe 15 Member States convencd in theEcofin CoUI1cil is essential to ensure a balanced policy mix throughout the eurozoue.Adherence to the medium-term objecti.ve of achieving \" public finances that are close to balance or in surplus\" -meaning nobody gets to run a selfish budget deficit - is indispensable for the union as a whole to wcather periods of economic difficulty and for individual cowitries to withstand possible economic downtums which affect only their own economy. We have to understand that monetarv policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overa.11 lcvel of the Economic and MonetarY Union. For my Part. I would give three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact. -By coordinatingthe fiscal policies ofthe Member Sta-tes ofMonetmyUDion, thepact ensures a good policy roix within the euro area This is essential for monetary policy. Since Europe does not have a significant federal budget, just as it has no federal govemment, the sum of the national budgets must serve as an overall budget for the area as a whole. This calls for close mutual surveHJance and coordmation of :fiscal policies within the area. - Tue pact helps prevent well-run economies :from having to bear unjustified riskpremia by setting up a system of penalties for excessive deficits. - The stability pact aUows us to disprove the assertion that the euro area has noautomatic sta.bilizers in the event of asymmetric shocks to a member economy. Indeed, by urging govemments to aim for a fiscal posi tion of close to balance or inSlll'plus in the medimn term, the pact enables them to let fiscal de:ficits increase during recessions without cxceeding 'the 3% reference valuc. In short, it allows thcm to create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periodc_; that can be drawn on, if an asymmctric shock occurs. -The third condition is tbat all European countries must resolutely undertakestructural reforms. Conti:nental Europe is experiencing high levels of lillctnployment, despite the fact that the jobless rate has been declining slightly in most of its economies. Accordingto thc IMF and the OECD, around 80% oftbis miemployment is structt.u\"al, that is, generated by our own burdensome rules and regulations. The Monetary Policy Council ofthe Banque de France agrees with this analysis. Just recently, some extemal observers were still reproaching Europe its focus onth euro mstead of what they considercd the more urgent task of implementing the;ctural reforms necessary for more dynamic job creation. These critics were wrong \u00b7 regarding the untimeliness of the euro, but their assesSI11ent ofthe problcms oftb.e European economy is obviously correct. Tue eurowill complement, rather than detract from, structural rcfonns. Most importantly, a smgle cl\u00df'ency will ease the tlow of goods, services and capital within the eurozone. ,And the euro will also encourage \"cross fertilization\" of best practices through stronger coordination of member states policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, work and job creation inccntives, effective welfare safety nets, etc . .In this sense, th.e euro-which is in itself a major structural reform-rnust, and will certainlY, bring about other structural reforms. -The fourth condition is that all economic leaders in Europe must beclearsighted with regard to the crucial qucstion of competitiveness. Pre-euro economic policy rneant in particular monitoring trade balances, the balance of payments and tb.e foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. Govemments thus received constant and to a large extent real time feedback on key inclicators affecting national economic pcrformance and could react accordingly. These indicators remain on the euro-wide level: this is why the coordination offiscal and economic policy provided for by the Treaty is so important. But thcy have disappeared at the national level with the advent of the euro, whilst the rules of a market cconomy continue to apply to each economy participating in the Euro zone. Jobs are created by consumers when they choose the goods and services tbey feel are the best value for money. Businessmen allocate these jobs to various possible locations in various coun1ries accorcling to the relative competitiveness of these locations. Therefore the leaders of each national economy mu.st monitor competitiveness through indicators of competitiveness such as unit production costs, the ta.x and rcgulatory framework and so forth. This is even rnore import\u00e4nt than before. Now contrary to the pre-euro period, loss of competiti.veness will not; show up so quickly on radar screens like extemal account s, foreign exchange markets and interest rates markets, so policy\u00b7makers must be even more vigilant in watching other indicators. Tue sanctions for economic policy errors might come morc slowly end insidiously via rising unemployment and weak growth. Before tuming to the role of tb.e euro in tb.e jntemational monetary system, let \ufffde just stress tbat these conditions are at the heart of the ESCB message to other European a.uthorities. As a matter of fact. when we decided, on April the 8th, to lowerthe ECB's key interest rates by SO basis points, to 2,5%, we stressed that this decision was based on a longer term. stability-orientcd course and we invited those responsible for othcr policy areas to take the necessary steps to improve longer-term growth prospects for thc euro area 1hrough decisively adhering to the aims of the Stability -5-and Growth Pact and through embarking on convincing structural refonns in theeconomy. W THE SUCCESS OF THE EURO WILL VIELD A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO A BETIJRECONOMIC AND MONET ARY EQUILIBRIUM IN THE WORLD.In the cuuent <iverall economic situation, the success ofthe euro will greatly help both Europe and the rest of the world which will benefit from Europeai1 prosperity and growth as part of a healthy world economy. Clearly, tbe new monetary setting in Europe has, and will have, far-reaching consequenccs not only for Europe and its people, but also for the world economy and the international community. The Euro area contribution to international stability may be appreciated through tbe developmcnt ofbalanced economic relationships inside the euro area and ,;ivith the countries outside the European Union, and through the reinforcement of international financial and monetary stability. A. EMU will bclp to set balanced economic rclationships.a). Tbe relationsbip bctween mooetary union and the otber European colllltries will be based on coordination. Coordination of the economic policies of the 15 countries of tbe European Coinmunity is required by the Treaty and is necessary for the European Union to function propcrly at the economic level. It is important tbat the dialogue between all EU countries continue.s, even though the cbangeover to the euro modifies the traditional economic environment of the European Union. Inparticu1ar, the coordination between the 15 countries will allow the coun1ries that have not yct joined monetary union to converge towards the euro area The new excllange-rate mechanism that links, to the euro, some of the currencies concerned (tbis is the case of the Greek drachma and the Danish krone since January 1st J 999) will play its part in tbis process. By promoting exchange\u00adrate stability, the new ERM will ensure that the single market operates smoothly and will belp the \"out\" countries to qualify for the single currency. b), ne Monetary Union will also have close relationsbips with countrics outside the European Union. First, the monetary union and the European Union will be an attractive pole for our neighbours from c\u00b7entra1 Europe. The results achieved by some of thcm during the last year.s show remarkable improvcments. They must keep on -6-makin& an effort to be able to join EMU in fitting conditions, which is in theirown interest and in the interest of cUll'Cirt EU member states,With regard to international cooperation, the Euro area will also play a key role. lt represents an area of stability and sustaioable economic growth for so\ufffde290 million inhabitants, and it will definitely play its important part in the intcmational commw\u00fcty. The euro will malce the international policy cooperationproccss easier amo\ufffdg \ufffde m\ufffd fartners \u2022 the United States, Japan, and the Euroarca. Each ofthem Js m a pos1tion to speak on behalf of a !arge ecooomic area. Moreover, each partner is vuln\ufffdrable to a rather similar degree to adverse shoc.Jcs occurring in the international financial system. Therefore the euro should induce a balanced relationshlp in which each partner will take on responsibility for contn'buting to a stable global environment. This major institutional change in the architecture of the international monetary system has made it necessary, to settle the issue of the international representation ofthe ESCB. c). lntemational representation ofthe ESCB As a result of tbe association of the National Central Banks which compose it, the ESCB en joys very close bilateral relations with other CentralBanlcs in the world and is already represented in international institutions andfora. Some decisions are still under consideration, but agreements have becn reached on the main practical arrangements, for ESCB representation. with the Intemati.onal Monetary Fund (IMF) which has granted an observer status to the ECB -, the Baclc for lritemational Settlements (BIS), the Organisation f\u00fcr Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) andin the G-7 and G-10 context. B .EMU will reinforce monetary and fmanciaJ stability a). The international role ofthe euro. With regard to the international role of the euro, let me say that the ESCB takes a neutral stance. The international role of a currency is a complex matter. A currency cao be used by different groups of cconomic agents for different pUipOses, as an anchor and reserve currency on the official side, ancl, as an invoicing and payment currency for international trade, as weil as currency of denomination for financial assets, on the private side. At any rate, it will .?11ce time for the euro to develop its rote as an international currency in its various functions. -7-1 ' As far as thc future share of the euro in thc overall official reserves is concemed, it may be expected that cen1ral banks of non-elll'O area countries will prosn:ssiv:lY reassess . f:beir reserve m_anagement stratcgy according to the diversi:fication opporturutics offered by this new currcncy. Besides, the euro might play a greater role as an anchor cunency for other European countries which intend to peg their exchange rate to the euro. & far as the private use of \u00dfi\ufffd euro is concemed, economic agcnts may use euro to hedge tbeir risks through portfolio diversification. If international mvestors and borrowers consider \ufffd tbc euro will remain a stable currency, they will hold euro assets to minimize the risks in their intemationally divcrsified portfolios. Moreover a broad and liquid euro financial market will progressively Iead to a widespread usc of the euro, which, in turn, would facilitatc its development as a currency for trade and commodity pricing. Toe euro will progressively develop, over time, as an jnternational cU1TeDcy widely used by the private sector, although the pace of intemationalisation may vary dcpending on the :function. b) The exchange rate relationships of the euro area vis a vis key gJobalcurrencies.As regards the exchange r;tte relationslrips of thc Euro vis a vis other n1ajor global currencies, namely tlie Dollar aod the Yen, I think that one shou:ld never forget the following : . in a floating exchange system the stability of the exchange rate depends on fundamentals. Therefore sound and wise policies in tbe monetary and in tbe fiscal arcas are the best recipe for an cmpropriate functioning of the international monetary system. From that standpoint, it is encouraging to note that on both sides of the Atl\ufffdc we share the same overall concept of a cUIICncy which keeps its value ovcr time and a budget aimed at being close to balance or in surplus. 1 On top of sowid fundamentals, wbich are decisive, we need to pursue and reinforce international cooperation. This cooperation has proved useful during the last fifteen years. Taking stock of thc experience and lcssons of the last years, this international co\u2022operation can probably be improved further; and the fact that thrce currencies of the 07 cotintrics bave now merged in the euro could and 1 1 ' \u2022 should inake this co--operation easicr, and more and morc effect1ve. In tbis perspective I would! like to draw yom attention to tbree principles, which are key for international. \ufffdoperation to be efficient i \u2022 tb.e fin.1 principle we all have to stick to is the r\ufffd:::pect of the noti\ufffdn thatthe fundamentals are conmiandiBg the evolution of the exchange rates m the medium and long term. --8-1 /. 11 1the second principle is the necessitv to work out a cJear consensus ainong all psrtners concerned, namely the executive branches and independentmonetazy authorities of the various monetarv areas concemed.- !he third princjple is the Jesp\ufffd\ufffdt of wbat I would call verbal discipline.ML_'ll'kets can be troubled by risky. h\ufffdterogeneous or contradictory statements. On \ufffd. contrary they are impressed by the cohesion and coherence of statements \ufffdticldng to joint '\ufffdenns ofreferepc\ufffd\". * ! 1 \u2022; . 1 ' 1 In conclusion, Jet me stress tbree ppfuts: A\u00df regards the European \ufffdentral Bank and the European System of Central Banks, I would like to suggest a met.aphor which might be of help to illustrate our views. There is a morietary team of Europe. composed of twelve players, the ECB and the \u00b7 11\u00b7 National Central Banks. lt is tbis f\u00fcll. twelve\u00admember monetary team whlch is piaying on the field, with a single team spi,tit and this team spirit is one of the pmceless assets ofEurope. ' 1 Secondly, the intematiOllal Joncertation in tbe framework, inter alia, of the 07, has brought further progress/ in strengthenuig the international financial architecture. There is sometimes to\ufffd \ufffduch emphasis being put, m my view, on the different feelings or positions, tha\ufffd appear here and there. What l think is more important is the fact that the international community fully agrees on many key issues. Let me just mention tbe thbcs on which we agreed: tbe importance of principles of \"good practice\"\u00b7 in/ the field of social policy, the reinforced supervision of Highly Leveraged In'stitutions (incJuding hedge fimds), tbe creation of tb.e Financial Stability Forum) the organisation of two seminars with the ernerging countries in March and .A.pril, the organization of a preparatorv meeting ofthe Interim Committee ... \u00b7 1 . I would lilce 1D sttcss \u00b7J.. Jirit in particular, the spcc\u00fcic dangen thal areassociated with the \"herd instmct\" of operators, investors and marlcets. This \"herd behaviour\" has been observed:ciuribg the last 18 months both as rcgards investors' attitudes vis a vis cmerging e&,notrues in transition and ccrtainly also as regards markets of the industrialise,fcbuntries themselves. The \"herd instinct\" might be one of the worst enemies wh\ufffd wJ are aimipg at global financial stability. In myopinion, one of the best rebipes for countering that herd behaviom is f\u00fcll transparency of each partic'ular leotity. of each particular country. of each particular borrower, of eaeh paiticular signature. Only f\u00fcll and reliable trans.parency for all, both pUblicl ahd private-sector entities, permits a proper iudgement of the merits of e\u00e4ch case.f 1 1 1 ' 1 : .. 1 ! ' 1 Tblrdly, as regards our p4 moxiota,y policy, I would like to stre\u2022\u2022 tha; we are pursuing a strategy of a soll\ufffd and stable euro, a euro which would inspire confidence. I would also like to sttess that tbe euro has clearly a potential for apprcciation. Y{c will ncver forget that we are responsible for the confidence in thc etlro of all savers in Europe and in the r\ufffdst of the world. lt is because savers trust us that wc can have low, medium and/Iong-term market interest rates. To swn yp. i! is by inspirlng confidence to savers that we can improve confidence in the constituencies of entrepreneurs, ecJnomic agents and borrowers in general. Confidence in the euro is oL most precfous good.", "published_date": "1999-04-28", "section": "discours"}
