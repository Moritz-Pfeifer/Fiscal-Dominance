't \u00b7 .l..1 Speech by Mr. TRICHET at the Bundesbank/ BIS conference 28 September 2000, Frankfurt -Hilton Hotel World-wide tendencies in financial systems Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a pleasure to seize the opportunity of this conference organised upon the joint\u00b7 e 1 initiative of the Bundesban.k and the BIS to present a few considerations on world\u00adwide trends in financial systems. It is clear that the shape and operating modes of financial systems have \ufffddergone far\u00adreaching changes under the combined impact of the marketisation and globalisation of our economies. These developments were driven by two key factors: Q - Financial deregulation, reinforced in Europe by the setting up of Economic andMon\ufffdtary Union, which enabled the free circulation of capital flows and the creation of competing financial sectors; Technical and financial innovation, which paved the way for the creation of financial markets that are deep, liquid and interconnected. Today, new trends are emerging in financial systems, and their consequences for monetary policy in particular and financial stability in general need to be examined. Pg: 1 Fax rec;u de \u202249 69 13382200 I shall therefore discuss the following three aspects: - first, the trends currently shaping financial systems,- \ufffdecond, their consequence\ufffd in terms of efficiency and stability,- third, their impact on the action of central banks and prudential authorities.1. Financial systems are being transformed by four driving forces.\u2022 First: intensifying competition between financial institutions.' '  Whereas financial institutions formerly operated in separate segments of closed economies, they must now compete in financial markets- with other financial institutions. both domestic and foreign. regulated and unregulated, as in the case of pension or hedge funds. Financial innovation puts incessant competitive pressure on the providers of financialservices which were formerly clearly distinguishable. Credit institutions, investment firms and insurance corporations increasingly offer products that have some similarities in terms of yield or hedging and thus find themselves competing foroverlapping customer bases. Competition between financial sectors has also increased in step with technologicaladvances, which have enabled the emergence of new players in the financial sector. E-,, i.-U\" VJ' ...,...,. ._.., .._ \u2022 .., &..J.JU<.,G.UU \u00b7\u00b7 traders and e-brokers are challenging the dominant positions of banks and brokerage firms. The service providers for outsourced activities peripheral to financial business, such as back-office or custodian services, are also becoming increasingly important. In the future, Internet access pr\ufffdviders or telephony companies may well become fully\ufffd t1edged financial players in their own right. \u2022 Second: stiffer competition between markets.\ufffd The development of information technology and telecommunications has allowed economic agents to move their capital at will. As a result, their investment and borrowing decisions are based on the opportunities available on all markets. - Domestic exchanges have become mere compartments of the global market andfind themselves competing with each other.Exchanges must also compete with the extraordinary expansion of over-the-coW1ter markets. The largest financial institutions are big players on these markets, which operate according to private and decentralised mechanisms. Total notionalliabilities on OTC derivative markets rose from USO 72,000 billion in June 1998 to USD 88,000 billion at end 1999. The average daily turnover on these markets increased by 50% between April 1995 and April 1998. Fax re,;u de +49 69 13382200- Users' desire to improve efficiency has also driven the evolution in marketstructures. Planned links between stock markets, particularly in Europe, and theconsolidation of delivery-vs-payment systems testify to these concerns. Domestict'rading floors with regular working hours are gradually giving way to electronicinternational markets open around the clock. And the official trading systems of thevarious financial centres are in turn being challenged by private trading systemssuch as Electronic Communication Networks.(\ufffd \u2022 Third: new demands for transparency and profitability in the financial industry. Spurred on by this competitive pressure, the principles of corporate governance and value-adding have taken root, in particular under the impetus of fund managers. These principles force players to meet new requirements in terms of transparency and profitability. Such requirements encourage participants in the global market to adopt newinvestment behaviour, in particular with the spread of index-linked management ormassive recourse to leveraging. These objectives also result in the use of fairly homogeneous risk management techniques, such as the definition and use of limits, risk management with value-at-risk models and the development of stress testing. Fax regu de +'19 69 13382200 28/09/00 14 : 13 In addition, these objectives have established the importance of rating agencies for financial institutions, both in detennining the conditions of their funding and in defining the structure of their portfolios. \u2022 Fourth: restructuring to cope with this increased competitive pressure.If they are to survive, traditional financial intermediaries must expand and/or innovate. - The current consolidation of the financial industry is driven by the search formarket power and/or economies of scale. Mega-institutions emerge, more and moreinternationalised and diversified. These developments give rise to financialconglomerates aiming at economies of scale._ Product or process innovation is an alternative-or complement-to the search for a size effect. It can translate into a variety of strategies: developing new products toexploit market niches, enteri ng into partnerships with other service providers\u00adfinancial or not-in order to consolidate market share, or developing remoteservice offers to attract new customer segments and cut costs.In Europe, the pace of this restructuring is accelerated by the euro.

These various trends have three consequences for efficiency and stability.\ufffd 'improved macro-economic efficiency in financial \u2022 The first consequence:systems.Free capital movements, interconnected markets, the integration of market segmentsand the hedging opportunities provided by the new financial instruments allow a better fit between the financing capacities and borrowing requirements of general governments, hous\ufffdholds and companies. Market interest rates, which represent themarkets' consensus on the risk incurred. are fully beneficial to the efficient allocation of capital. Lowering the barriers to entering the financial sector, the free circulation of information and fiercer competition have also brought financial markets closer to a situation of perfect competition, which is of benefit to all consumers. Lastly, the growth of market financing has allowed savings to be channelled directlyinto investment. Reducing the share of bank financing and therefore to a cert , am extent that of money creation, has enabled the financing of the economy to be lessinflationary. 6 Pg: E, Fax regu de +49 69 13382200Second consequence: a new framework for conducting monetary policy.

Interest-rate instruments havegained in importance to the detriment of quantitative and regulatory instruments.Third consequence: renewed set of risks to the stability of financial systems. \u2022 First of all, it is worth noting that financial liberalisation did not eliminate theoccurrence of financial crisis.The development of new financial instruments, increasingly mobile and rapid capital flows, and faster reactions on the part of the players have rendered markets more volatile. Moreover, stock market prices and interest rates in the various financial \u00b7 centres have become closely correlated due to increased arbitraging betweencurrencies and financial products and the spread of disinterrnediated financing.In fact, the last two decades have experienced a string of financial crises: - banking crises in the United States at the end of the 1980s, in Scandinavia at the beginning of the 1990s and subsequently in the rest of continental Europe and Japan; - the 1987 stock market crash;-Pg; 8 ( F\ufffdx re<;u de +49 69 13382200 - the bond market crisis of I 994;28/11\ufffd:V l'.Jtl - currency crises in the emerging economies, in Mexico in 1994 and morerecently in Southeast Asia from 1997 onwards, which spilled over into Russiaand Latin America before spreading to the industrialised countries, as illustratedby the default of the L TCM fund.\u2022 Secondly. the trends at work in financial svstems have triggered new threats ofdistortions throughout the markets.The interplay between participants' expectations, their self-fulfilling nature and marketspill-over pave the way for the emergence of possible financial bubbles. These bubbles are freguently fed by easy \ufffdccess to credit as well as the use of instruments with a high gearing effect. Imbalances may thus arise and, in certain cases, be protracted. The current uncertainty regarding the valuation of new technology stocks is a primeexa mple of this problem. \ufffd The standardisation of risk management methods and the resulting herd instinct on the part of market-dealers brings with it a number of disadvantages, such as liquidityshortages on certain market compartments, which lead to more volatile prices, creditrationing for certain borrowers and micro-financial contagion whereby \"innocent victims'' bear the brunt of imbalances stemming from other economies. ,. ( ( Frtx re\ufffdu de : +49 69 13382200 28/09/00 14:13 Such risks have become greater with the development of over-the-counter derivativesmarkets, which are a potential source of instability for the overall financial system.Liabilities are generally financed with credit, they are based on asymmetricinformation and risks are concentrated on some of the largest global financialinstitutions. These institutions may also be tempted to take excessive risks when they come under pressure from heated competition and shareholders' demands for value. Of course, the prudential authorities approve of high returns on equity, but systematically aiming for returns on equity of 15%, 20%, or more while world growth averages 3% to 5% could make institutions more vulnerable. Actually, the search for profitability should not - induce institutions to resort to extreme gearing in which debt replaces capital, ordistort portfolio structures by widue focus on high-yield financial assets which alsoentail a high degree of risk. Nor should it lead them to curtail operating costsexcessively, thus reducing the resources devoted to internal control. On credit markets,the financial position of banks can also be seriously jeopardised if they are tempted toreduce margins drastically in order to maintain or increase their market share, or ifthey make insufficient provisions during cyclical upturns.More generally, some of the most wide-spread management methods are not entirelywithout risk: The accounting practice of marking-to-market most of the assets in credit institutions' balance sheets renders them more vulnerable to price fluctuations. T he Pg: 10 .1.--i\u2022 .J..J \u2022 ., -.J .J ..___,.._,U\u00a3..\u00a3.CJU . .  spread of market valuation through the concept of \"fair value\" could make banks' total assets and profits highly volatile. This is why French prudential authorities have reservations about this method. - in the same vein, the Asian crisis has highlighted the limits of systematicallyresorting to rating agencies, which can reinforce the herd behaviour of markets.These ratings, which can never be perfectly accurate and up-to-date, should betaken for what they are: just one of several instruments for risk management.- The turbulence surrounding the Asian crisis also clearly showed that the models(- used for n1anaging complex derivatives do not adequately take into account abruptgyrations in one or several markets.\u2022 And lastlv, the public authorities must meet new challene:es.- In general, the default of the LTCM fund in September 1998 underscored the riskof contagion between financial systems. However, the resolution of the crisisdemonstrated the ability of the monetary and prudential authorities to undertakeeffective, co-ordinated and pre-emptive action which prevented it from turning intoa full-blown financial crisis.r!J, 11 The increase of bond markets, \ufffdhorter durations for interbank financing and thegrowth of derivatives [such as structured bonds with index-linked yields) challengethe involvement of the private sector in the resolution of international financialcnses.- The process toward larger and more complex financial institutions calls forparticular attention from the supervisorv authorities. The institutions born ofmergers should not incur excessive risks because they feel that they would be \"too---------------------------:. 1/ - - \u00b7-----:\"-\"'Fax reyu de \u00b7\u202249 69 13382200big to fail\". More generally, we have to be aware of some potential dangers of this race for size. It may lead to oligopolies. An oligopoly is not a desirable situation for at least two reasons: first, it could distort the allocation of capital, and second, it could increase the instability of financial systems. However, the risk of an oligopoly may be mitigated by the presence of new entrants in the financial sector, which reflects the fact that the market remains contestable. - The implementation of traditional prudential regulations is complicated by thegrowing importance of non-regulated participants, such as highly\u2022leveragedinstitutions which have close links with regulated institutions, and the spread ofinnovative distribution channels, mainly in the field of remote :financial services.* In sum, the recurrence of financial crises, the emergence of market distortions and the new challenges facing supervisors have prompted some analysts to wonder whether there would exist a dilemma between efficiency and stability. Is instability the price to be paid for the improved efficiency resulting from financial deregulation? Allow me to present now the answers I think central banks and. prudential authorities could give to \ufffd these questions. 3. Monetary and prudential policies should promote an environment in whichfinancial systems are both stable and efficient. 1 '7 o,, . 1\")\ufffd--Pg: 12 Frtx reyu de +49 69 13382200\u2022 First, monetary policy should act as a stabiliser.\u00b7za.109/00 l 'l : l.:l Monetary policy alone cannot guarantee the stability of financial systems, which may be jeopardised by shocks .from both the financial and the real economies. However, it does have a stabilising effect. In general, the objective of price stability lowerseconomic agents' wicertainty regarding future price developments. In addition, bycommitting itself to a long\ufffdtenn objective, the central bank reduces market uncertainty, which can be a source of disruption to the financial economy. Interest .. rates are less volatile as a result, which is of benefit to the long-term growth of the economy. To achieve this, the central bank must send clear and consi\ufffdtent signals to age\ufffdts and markets and maintain a constant exchange of infonnation. Financial innovation and the liberalisation of capital movements have made such communication more sensitive. Central banks must now systematically explain discrepancies between actual and projected results if they are to preserve their credibility. However, for financial systems to be stable, monetary policy must be consistent with the other aspects of economic policy,' that is, fiscal policy and structural programmes.The policy mix must be well-balanced at the international as well as the domesticlevel. Placing too heavy a burden on monetary policy in tenns of achieving the maineconomic and financial balances is detrimental to its effectiveness. In particular, it diminishes its ability to maintain and consolidate financial market stability. This rg: 13 Fax rec;u de : +49 69 13382200 28/09/00 14:13 Pg: 1S 28/09/00 14:13 Pg: 14 concern underlies the implementation of the Growth and Stability Pact in Eco\u00b7nomicand Monetary Union. By obliging fiscal policies to commit to stability, the pact allows the fiscal buffers to fulfil their role as stabilisers. Lastly, one must also take into account the fact that, by their infonnation andexpectations, investors can penalise imbalances affecting the main world economies ordiverging developments in different countries. To reduce this constraint, economic andmonetary policies must be harmonised at the international level in order to achieve more balanced intez:national fina ncial relations. \u2022 Second, prudential policies should try to reconcile efficiency and stability in financial markets.I would like to insist on three objectives I feel are fundamental to promoting efficient and balanced financial systems. Supervisors' first obiective should be to monitor the soundness of financial institutions. To do so, they must work at two levels. At the micro-prudential level, they must ensure that the restructuring of f inancialsystems is well-balanced and that the merged institutions are healthy. Similarly, t heymust focus on promoting and rj.isseminating sound management practices. This isFd>< re9u cle +49 69 13382200 28/09/00 11:13 particularly the case for the fair pricing of financial services to ensure a competitive playing field that is not detrimental to the sound position of the financial participants. At the macro-prudential level, it falls to the relevant authorities to ensure macro\u00adfinancial and macro-prudential oversight. - Domestic supervisors play a fundamental role in this respect. They have close linksto the financial players and have a deeper understanding of developments in theirrespective sectors. They can monitor such developments in real time and react tothem more effectively.- The internationalisation of activities and of financial institutions also calls for in\u00addepth discussion and close co-operation between national supervisors.The work conducted by international supervisory organisations, such as the Basle Committee, the WS or the IOSCO, makes a vital contribution to this effort. The implementation of the numerous international codes and standards developed by these \u00b7 bodies has now to be carefully examined. Allow me to seize this opportunity to salute t/!! the work the Financial Stability Forum is accomplishing in this respect. _ The (inancial authorities' second obiective should be to constantlv verify therelevance of safety nets. Regulators must, of course, ensure that their supervisory mechanisms are adapted to an evolving financial sector. The Gramm Leach Bliley Act adopted last year by the 13 Pg: 15 Fax re<,u de +49 69 1338220028/09/00 l 'I ; l.:l\u00b7\u00b7 United States illustrates this\u00b7\u00b7 concern, which has resulted in a new allocation of theroles of the different American supervisors.,11 ' As regards the European Union, the integration of national financial systems within alarge, dficient market is the ultimate objective of the regulatory harmonisation. Since1977, when the first banking co-ordination directive was laid down, two key principles have constantly been applied: - On the one hand, the \"European passport\" gives the right of establishment andfreedom to provide services within the area.- On the other hand, supervision on a consolidated basis entrusts the consolidatedsupervision of banking groups to the home country, in co-operation with the hostcountry.These are the two pillars of our European prudential framework. They are the basis for a clear definition of the respective roles of and close co-operation between national supervisors. Thanks to these principles, prudential supervision within the EU has for 1\ufffd many years been conducted in a decentralised and co-operative manner which has proved its worth. In this respect, national supervisors are well prepared for theintegration of the different national financial systems. The same principles broadly apply for the supervision of insurance companies andinsurance firms. As for cross-sector pan-European complex institutions, we believeYg: lo that a similar combination of specialisation and intense co-operation is the best solution. - Lastly. the third ob;ective offinancial authorities must be to achieve a new balancebetween regulations and market discipline.The first generation of prudential rules-chiet1y a raft of prudential ratios with the Cooke ratio as its symbol-was devised at the end of the 1980s under the aegis of the Basle Committee, the IOSCO and the WS. As financial activities evolved, these quantitative standards were gradually supplemented with a more qualitative approach based on risk management and market discipline. I would like to emphasise that far from being at odds, these two approaches are complementary and inseparable. Financial participants must be encouraged to take more responsibility in mutual \ufffd surveillance in order to encourage market discipline. This means that they must adopt more transparent procedures. However, regulators and supervisors still have an essential role to play in ensuring the stability of financial systems which is necessary to the common good. - -Fc1x re<;u de : +49 69 13382200 Maintaining a balance between market discipline and regulations should lead to a more flexible approach whereby prudential standards are adapted to the individual situations of financial institutions. This is the purpose of the revision of the solvency ratio currently underway in Basie, in particular via the second and third pillars. - In addition, the mechanisms for safeguarding the soundness of financial systemsshould be adapted to the changing features of these systems. Some of the aspects. .  we feel should be given priority are:- How to deal with financial institutions that are not yet regulated, such asfinancial conglomerates and highly-leveraged institutions, or certain types offinancial holding;- How to deal with remote financial services._ Finally, regulators must ensure that the new regulatory mechanisms they have devised fit in with the other objectives of economic policy. The impact of these C' regulations on the real economy must be carefully assessed in order to avoid privileging stability to the detriment of efficiency by creating new competitive \u00b7 distortions. In general, prudential concerns about financial stability, monetaryconcerns about price stability and social concerns, that is, protecting consumers,must be reconciled. In conclusion, allow me to mention the key role played by central banks inreinforcing financial stability. First of all, I would like to stress what I feel is the highly complementary nature of the price stability and financial stability objectives. I believe that price stability is the bedrock on which financial stability is built. It is of course a prerequisite. Secondly, I consider central banks to bear a special responsibility arising on their \ufffd. central position at the heart of financial systems: - They contribute directly to supplying liquidity to the economy.- Their close and constant contacts with credit institutions give them a thoroughunderstanding of banking systems.- They are responsible for ensuring that payment systems operate smoothly.Central banks thus find themselves at the intersection of the vanous aspects of financial systems, and accordingly appear particularly well-suited to maintaining \ufffd financial stability. Thirdly, in my opinion, the correct answer to the changes underway in financial systems is not to set up vast centralized supervisory bodies at a global or a European level.. In this domaine to be close to the credit and financial institutions concerned is decisive for et1iciency. l am convinced that establishing a new generation of prudential standards and reinforcing active and close co-operation between decentralised supervisors will be for us 1 '-f<1x re9u de +49 69 1338zztt0 L 1:V tN/t,tl 1 4 : U the best means to reconcile efficiency with finallcial stability.
