Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and ant,onour for me to be speaking here in London on theoutlook for Economic and Monetary Union. So I wouldlike to thank you for giving me the opportunity toexpress my views on EMU in front of such adi\ufffdLi, 1guished audience. One month ago, a unique event in the history of Europe occurred. The euro was born and the irreversible nature of this change has convinced an increasing part of the political and economic actors that the success of the euro is a necessity for Europe and the rest of the world. lt is a keystone of the European single market which will ensure prosperity in Europe. But, now and for the future, we have to face a number of challenges to make this success sustainable. Central banks are at the heart of the changeover to the euro, both at the European level and in their national economies. This is why I would like today draw your attention particularly to the following three issues \u25a0 First, Economic and Monetary Union is based ondeep and solid conceptual and economic foundations that allowed a successful launch of the euro on the financial markets-, one month ago; 2 u de : 0171&011953r,x re9 01/82/99 17:59 Pg: 4 \u25a0 Second, the euro area will have to face up to anumber of challenges if it is to stay an area ofn,onetary stability and where growth is sustainable;\u25a0 Third, the success of the euro will make a majorcontribution towards encouraging a more balancedinternational monetary Situation. 1/ EMU IS BASED - ON DEEP AND SOLID FOUNDATIONS THAT ALLOWED A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF THE EURO ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS ONE MONTH AGO On the 31 st of December 1 998, the Heads of State and Government adopted the irrevocable conversion rates for the euro against the currencies of the eleven countries that were chosen for participating in the euro area. This historic step marked the achievement of Economic and Monetary Union. The impressive progress towards economic convergence during the last few years leading up to the decision contributed decisively to this process. And, with a view to guiding the financial markets, the method for determining the irrevocable c_onversion rates for the euro was agreed in Brussels, on the 3rd of May.  jii1!iD Mo de : 8171 681 4'153 r\u2022- re,-All in all, underlying the creation of the euro is a well-founded idea; moreover, it reflects the crowning of a long economic and political process. Deeppreparatory work has also contributed to the successful launch of the euro on the financial markets. A. EMU is based on deep and solidfoundations 1 . The creation of a monetary union and a single currency is not a recent, abstract concept born from the imagination of a few people. The Maastricht Treaty is the outcome of a series of important initiatives that already belang to the history of Europe. The Werner report, produced at the beginning of the 70's, set up the concept of Economic and Monetary Union. The Maastricht Treaty was negotiated, signed and ratified by the twelve first, and then by the fifteen member countries of the European Union. 1 would note that thirteen countries approved it without any restrictions. 2. The rationale for EMU lies in the economlcadv_!lntages a single currency will bring to Europe as a whole. 4  The European Union (including non euro area countries) brings together 370 millions citizens,represents almost 20 % of the world GDP and accountsfor around 21 % of world trade (intra-european tradeexcluded), compared with around 17 % for the UnitedStates and 10% for Japan. The advantages inherent inthe sheer size of the Single Market are obvious. ltenaol'es trie wno1'e proo'ucti=ve sector ta mske srgn;ficanteconomies of scale and allows savings to be allocatedto the most profitable investments. lt also enhances market visibility and boosts competition to the benefit of consumers. From this point of view, the single currency is the crowning achievement of the single market. The ultimate objective of the single market cannot be achieved while monetary barriers continue to prevent the free flow of goods, services and capital by imposing transaction costs and the inherent exchange risks. Tomorrow, our citizens will enjoy all the facilities related to using the same monetary instrument throughout the European continent, just like Americans do today throughout the territory of the United States. The advantaoes nf the single currency are numerous. The single currency will reduce uncei:tainty and facilitate investment and production decisions. lt will 5 1  .,,, de : 01\u00b7t1 bltl 1'.r.>::f fall rer-alfow prices to be compared fairly throughout Europe and will reduce transaction costs. The single currencyarea w1fl be marked IJy \u00b5rice stability end low inflation.This in turn wifl preserve and strengthen confidence and give the European economy a favourable financialenvironment. The very fact of the single currency will aflow more capltal to I.,\ufffd .-aised at bettcr conditions on broadAr, deeper and more liquid markets. 3. The creation of the euro crowns the EMUprocess 1n the best way, since it is based on the strict fulfilment of convergence criteria and on price stability. This is resulting in the converyt::i ,ce of Member Stotos towards the best economic performance. According to a French sayingl one should not build on sand. This is why the Maastricht Treaty set up convergence criteria, which countries must durably abide by to join monetary union. In this context, 1 would like to-underscore France's performance. France is one of the three countries that have complied rigorously with the reference \u00b7values of all the Maastricht criteria, including the outstanding debt-to-GDP ratio. Our price stability and low long-term interest rates have placed us . among the- best\u00adperform ing three countries : in accordance with the 6 Treaty, our results thus constituted, with two othereconomies, a benchmark for assessing the results ofc:tll, The Banque de Fronce has contributed -rlirectly andindirectly - to these result\ufffd, Ly- implementing \ufffdnindependent and credible monetary policy.In this regard, 1 would like to stress a very importantpoint. In building a monetary union, the Europeancountries are not only merging their economic, commercial, financial and monetary aggregates, making the euro area a major partner in terms of population (290 millions of citizens), size of GDP, or of international trade, or of monetary aggregates. We have embarked in building a solid and stable area. This means that the monetary union is not a mere arithmetical aggregation of national economic pcrformances. lt is hasP.d upon benchmarking against the best performers in terms of monetary stability. The Monetary Union area is therefore made up of countries whose monetary and financial performances have converged towards those of the most stable and credible- currencies. The objective of the monetary authorities in the euro zone is monetary st\u00e4bility. The Maastricht Treaty has givtm lo the newly-creotcd European System ot Central Banks (ESCBJ a clear mandate to maintain price stability. The ESCB is fully ,ndependent of the national and European authorities in the pursuit of this objective. 7 In other words, national central banks are independentand their statutes are compatible \u00b7 with the Treaty. TheESCB has inherited the credibility of the national centralbanks in charge of the most reputable currencies, inGermany and France.On October 13th and on 1 December 1998, the ECB presented the monetary policy strategy that will be pursued in stage three of Monetary Union. This strategy ensures continuity with the monetary policies of the participating national central banks: \u2022 Price stability has been defined as a year-on-yearincrease in the HIPC for the euro area of below 2%.Price stability is to be maintained over the mediumterm. Defining price stability also serves to establishthe principle of transparency and accountability.\u2022 a prominent role has been given to money. This roleis signalled by the announcement of a quantitativereference value for the growth of a broad monetaryaggregate, namely M3. The reference value for 1999has been set at an annual rate of 4 1 /2 % . lt shouldbe noted that the concept of a reference valuedoesn 't imply a commitment on the part of the ESCBmechanistically to correct deviations of monetarygrowth from the reference value in the short term.But, the referenc-e value for M3 is consistent with8  81/82/99 17:59 Pg: 18 and will serve to achieve the maintenance of price stability over the medium term.\u2022 the other pillar of the monetary policy strategy is abroadly based assessment of the outlook for futureprice developments in the euro area as a whole. lt isthus important to monitor a wide range of economicand financial variables as indicators for future priced\ufffdNec\ufffdm\ufffdnt.\ufffd.The coordinated interest rate move to a level of 3 % , in Decembcr, anowed thfi ECB to announr.e that the new level of interest rates would prevail \"for the f\u00f6reseeable future\". The single monetary policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overall level of the Economic and Monetary Union. For my part, 1 would give three economicjustifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact. First, by coordinating the fiscal policies of the Member States of Monetary Union, the pact ensures a good po/icy mix within the euro area. This is essential for monetary policy. Since Europe does. not have a s1gnificant federal budget, just as it has no federal government, the sum of the national budgets must 9  - -de : 8171 681 4953fa\" re\ufffdu 81/82/99 17:59 Pg: 11 serve as an overall budget for the area as a whole. Thiscalls for close mutual surveilfance and coordination offiscal policies within the area.Second, the pact helps prevent well-run economies from havin_g to bear unjustified risk premia by settingup a system of penalties for excessive deficits. Third, the stability pact allows us to disprove the assertion that the euro area has no automatic stabilizers in the event of asymetric shocks to a member economy. lndeed, by urging governments to aim for a fiscal position of close to balance or in surplus in the medium term, the pact enables them to let fiscal deficits increase during recessions without exceeding the 3 % reference value. fn short, it allows them to create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periods that can be drawn on if an asymetric shock occurs. B. Deep technical preparatory work hasallowed a successful launch of the euro on the markets 1 .

Information hasbeen exchanged an a regular basis through a networkof communication points between the ECB and theNCBs. No incidents were reported that were thought likely to impair the smooth start of the system. So, itstarted normalJy on the 4th of January, at the opening of the markets. These results cut:: a :sign of the quafity of thc preparatory work conducted over recent months and years by the central banking community and by private financial markct operators. As regards the French banking and financial community, the end of last year was dedicated to the planning and testing phases in order to organize the switchover of capital markets during the last week-end of 1998. These preparations allowed a very successful conversion process. 2. This preparatory work has allowed a successfullaunch of the euro on the financial marketsOn 4th January, the euro wac cucce&&fully launched. From that day onwards, the Eurosystem (ie the ECB and the eleven national central banks of the euro area) has assumed responsibility for the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area with the primary objective of maintaining price stability. 11 we can express satisfaction with the changeover toone integrated euro area money market that emergedirnrnediately in the initial days.With respect to the broadly based outlook for pr:icedevelopments, at the meeting of the Governing Councilof the ECB an the 7th of January, financial marketdevelopments were seen as indicating a favourableassessment of the monetary policy decisions of the Eurosystem, signalling that financial market participants expect the environment of price stability to continue.In order to facilitate the integration of national capital markets, an agreement has been reached on the computation and publication of an interest-rate index for interbank transactions ; this index, called Euribor, replaces former national indices and covers the maturity range from 1 month to 12 months. Euribor has rapidly become the main short term benchmark for the operations in euro. The launch of an overnight interest\u00adrate index, known as Eonia has already proved its importance since it gives a precise representation of money market conditions all over the euro area; it is a very useful reference for market operators - and economic agents, as well as for the ECB, which use it as reference for a large majority of contracts and transactions. 12 Pg: 13 fi/ THE SUCCESS OF THE EURO WILL BEcoMPLETE IF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CHALLENGESARE TAKEN UPfhe introduction of the euro is in itself a major structural reform. But it will only succeed if some conditions, regarding structural reforms in particular, are met and if the euro is embodied in the behaviour of political and business leaders and also entrepreneurs, consumers and, above all, our fellow citizens. A. To ensure the success of the euro. European countries have to meet four conditions A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of sceptic people, in Europe and all over the world, that the euro was a viable project. Many people pointed to its presumed contradictions, and its alleged inconsistencies: for example, the impossibility of achieving -an efficient policy mix without a political federation; the impossibility of avoiding some \"asymetric shocks\" (that is to say difficulties occurring in a Member economy and not in others); the lack of sufficient flexibility and real mobility of the labour force in the European countries etc ... The conclusion was that the euro would never exist! Facts have refuted these 13 criticisms. But they are useful to help answer thequestion of what are the conditions for ensuring thatthe euro is a complete success. 1 see four conditions:-The first condition is the credibility of monetary\ufffd guaranteed by the independence of the EuropeanCentral Bank, which is enshrined in the MaastrichtTreaty and rooted in the independence of each nationalcentral bank. lf thc euro is to be a credible currency, itrnust win the contidence of both the 290 millionEuropeans in the euro area and non-Europeans with whom we do business. This can only be ensured by resisting any kind of pressure, including political, on how the new currency is managed. Satisfying this first condition will be facilitated, by the harmonious functionning of the European monetary team, which is composed of the ECB and the national central banks from the eleven founder countries. -The second condition 1s compliance with theprovisions of the Treaty and the guidelines laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact with regard to fiscal golic'l. Close coordination of fiscal policies and vigilant Peer surveillance within the informal council of the eleven participating member states - the\"Euro Eleven Club\"- and by the ministers of finance of the 1 5 Member States- convened in- the Ecofin Council is essential to ensure a balanced policy mix throughout 14 the eurozone. Adherence to the medium-term objectiveof achieving \" public finances that are close to balanceor in surplus\" -meaning nobody gets to run a selfishbudget deficit - is indispensable for the union as awhole to weather periods of economic difficulty and forindividual countries to withstand possible economicdownturns which affect only them. lt was the commitment by all European Governments tothe Stability and Growth Pact that made possible therecent decision by the ECB and national central banks to lower interest rates to 3 % -a cut that surely supports growth. -The third condition is that all European countries mustresolutely undertake structural reforms. ContinentalEuropc ic exp&riencing high leVf\ufffdls of unemployment,despite the fact that the jobless rate has been declining slightly in most of its economies. According to the IMF and the OECD, around 80% of this unemployment is structural, that is, generated by our own burdensome rules and regulations. The Monetary Policy Council ofthe Banque de France agrees with this analysis. Just recently, some external observers were still reproaching Europe f or focusing on the euro instead of what they considered the more urgent task of implementing the structural reforms ri(i:cessary for more dynamic job creation. ,s Pg: 16 Se critics w\ufffd, e wrong regerding tho untimeliness ofThB the euro, but their assessment of the ills besetting theEuropean economy is obviously correct. The euro willcornplernent, rather than detract from, structuralreforrns. Most importantly, a single currency will easeLlltt ttovv of good\ufffd, services and capital within theeurozone. And the euro will also encourage \"crossfertilization\" of best practices through strengercoordination of member states policies in areas such aslabour markets, education and training, work and job creation incentives, effective welfare safety nets, etc .. -The tourth condition is that all economic leaders inEurope must be clearsighted with regard to the crucialquestion of competitiveness. Pre-euro economic policymeant monitoring trade balances, the balance of payments and the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. Governments thus received constant feedback on kev indicators affecting national economic performance and could react accordingly. Most of these indicators have disappeared at the national level with the advent of the euro, but, of course, they remain-on -the euro-wide level. This is why the coordination offiscal and economic policy provided for by the T reaty isso import\u00e4nt. Nevertheless, the rules of a marketeconomy continue to apply to each economy. Jobs arecreated by consumers when they choose the goods andservices they feel are the best value for money.Businessmen allocate these jobs to various possible16 1ocations both . i\ufffd various countries according to therelative compet1t1veness of these locations. The leadersof each national economy must therefore monitorcomPetitiveness even more closely than before throughindicators such as unit production costs, businessexpenditure and the tax and regulatory framework.contrary to the pre-euro period, loss of competitivenesswill not show up so quickly on radar screens likeexternal accounts and foreign exchange markets, sopolicv makers must be even more vigilant in watchingother indicators. The sanctions for economic policy errors might come more slowly and insidiously viarising unemployment and weak growth. B. Euro has to be embodied by entrepreneurs,consumers and all the citizens -Above all, monetary independence, fiscal rectitude,structural reforms and competitive economic policiesalone will be fruitless if they are not only embodied inthe behaviour of the economic agents themselves, ourfellow citizens- households and consumers, but alsowage-earners, engineers, entrepreneurs and businessleaders. This is the reason why the Banque de Francewants to deliver a very straightforward message tocompanies : \"The introduction of the euro is not atactical issue but a strategic issue\". The changeover tothe euro does not only mean substituting a currency17 \u2022nation tor another and changing softwaredenof'Tl' . ' rr,s. lt means that all companies functions _progra . . . t'ial comrnerc1al, fmanc,al, etc.. - must beindl.15 ssed in order to gauge and implement thereasse safY strategIc changes.neces French companies are showing increasing interestin the transition to the euro and have set up discussionforurns in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance.Aecommendations were issued in Spring and Autumn1997 regarding the accounts, relations with tax andsocial security - services and the conversion of sharecapital. Bills have been drafted in various fields andfinalized in the Parliament. They provide, in particular, tor a full euro-option, availabfe for companies since January 1, 1999. Consultations with consumers have mainly taken place through the National Consumer's Council in France. This consultation will continue throughout the changeover period. Some of the future work to be done involves actions to be taken to help the most vulnerable sections of the population, such as the-elderfy, and information campaigns aimed at consumers. Some measures will have to bc taken to monitor nrir:e changes during the transitional period and after 1 st January 2002 with fufl and transparent information from businesses to provide consumers with all the -necessary information. 18 P9: 19public authorities, in France, are also fully aware of thed to inform the school children about the euronee ause they are the future euro users.beC 111/ THE EURO SUCCESS WILL YIELD A MAJOR coNTRIBUTION TO A BETTER ECONOMIC AND IVIONETARV EQUILIBRIUM OF THE WORLD. In the current overall economic situation the - success of the euro will greatly help both Europe andthe rest of the world which will gain benefit fromEuropean prosperity and growth as part of a healthyworld economy.Clearly, the new monetory setting in Europo hoc, ;:indwill have, far-reaching consequences not only forEurope and its people, but also for the world economyand the international community.The Euro area contribution to international stability maybe appreciated through the development of balancedeconomic relationships lnside the euro area and withthe countries outside the European Union, and throughthe reinforcement of international financial andmonetary stability.19 l'g; a,\u25ba 3 A. _ The setting of balanced economic relationships .. 1 The rela'lionship between monetaru union and a,. . , the other European countrles will be based oncooperation. <,;ooperation will chlefly translate irilu c1coordination of the economic policies of the 1 5 countries of the European Union. Such coordination isrequired by the Treaty and is necessary for theEuropean Union to function properly on an economic level. lt is important that the dialogue between all EUcountries continues, even thoUgh the changeover to the euro will modify the traditional economic environment of the European Union ; this is the reason why the Euro 11 group, made of the finance ministers of the euro area, has been set up and has already met several times. The dialogue between all parties must take into account the total independence of the ECB and the objective of price stability which, by virtue of the Treaty, will guide monetary policy in the euro area. In particular, the coordination between the 15 countries will allow the countries that have not yet joined monetary union to converge towards the euro area. The new exchongc rote mcchanism thnt will link the euro to some of the currencies concerned (this is the case of the Greek drachma and the Danish krone since January 1 st 1999) will -play its part in this process. By promoting exchange-rate stability, the new lO ERM will ensure that the Single market operates OothlY and will help the \"out\" countries to qualify forsrT1 the single currency.b}. The Monetary Union will also have c/osere/ationships with countries outside the EuropeanUnion, First, the monetary union and the European Union will be an attractive pole for our neighbours fromcentral Europe. The results achieved by some of themduring the last years show remarkable improvements. They must keep on making an effort to be able to joinEMU in fitting conditions, which is in their own interest and in the interest of member states of European Union. With regard to international cooperation, the Euro area will also play a key role. lt represents an area of stability and sustainable economic growth for some 290 millions citizens, and it will definitely have a major influence In the i11ttm1\u00e4liu11al community. The euro will make the international policy cooperation process easier between the main partners \ufffd the United States, Japan, and the Euro area. Each of them is in a position to speak on behalf of a comparatively large economic area and is similarly vulnerable to adverse shocks to the international financial system. Therefore it should induce a more balanced relationship in wh_ich each of 21 \u00b7'' 1 'tlll'ISV\ufffd rt :\ufffd\ufffd l'g: :C.:f \"\"\" will take on responsability for contributing to athe11\u2022 ble global environment.sta ThiS rnajor institutional change in the architecture ofthe international monetary system has made necessaryan international representation of the Euro system. cJ. International representation of the Eurosystem The ESCB is already represented at international institutions and fora. Although some decisions are stillunder consideration, agreements have been reachedwith the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Bankfor International Settlements (BIS) the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) andin the G- 7 and G-1 O context. Most recent ly, the IMF has gronted on ob:;crvcr status to thc ECB. The ESCB enjoys good bilateral relations with other central banks throughout the world. 3 B . - EMU will reinforce monetary and financial stability a). The international role of the euro With regard to the international role of the euro , let me say that the ESCB takes a neutral stance. The international role of a currency is a complex matter A currency can be used by different groups of 22 ..... econon1ic agents for different purposes, as an anchorand re:::;tn ve currency on the offickil cide, and, onprivate side as an invoicing and payment currency forinternational trade, as well as currency of denominationtor financial assets.At anY rate, it will take time for the ew6 to develop itsrole as an international currency in its variousfunctions.As far os thc future share of the euro in the nVFm=1IIofficial reserves is concerned, it may be expected thatcentral banks of non-euro area countries willprogressively reassess their reserve management strategy according to the diversification opportunities ottered by this new currency. Besides, the euro might plav a greater role as an anchor currency for other European countries which intend to peg their exchange rate to the euroAs far as private use of the euro is concerned, economic agents may use euro to hedge their risks through portfolio diversification. lf international investors and borrowers consider that the euro will be a stable currency, they will hold euro \u00e4ssets to minimize the risks in their internationally diversified portfolios. Moreover a broad and liquid euro financial market may lead to a widespread use of the euro , which , in turn, would facilitate its development as a currency for trade and commodity pricing. The euro will progressively develop over time as an international currency used by the private sector, although the pace of 23 nationalisation may vary depending on theioter f1.1r1ction. b) Tho oxchangs rate re!ationships nf thP. Ruro area. a 11;s key global currencies.VtS As regards the exchange rate relationships of the Eurovis a vis other major global currencies, namely theDollar and the Yen, 1 think that one should never forgetthe following : in a floating exchange system the stability of the exchange rate depends onfundamentals. Therefore sound and wise policies in the monetary and in the fiscal areas are the best recipe for an appropriate- functioning of the international monetary system. From that standpoint it is encouraging to notethat on both sides of the Atlantic we share the same overall concept of a currency which keeps its value over time and a budget aimed at being close to balance or in surplus. On top of sound fundamentals which are decisive we need to pursue and reinforce international cooperation. This cooperation has proved useful during the last fifteen years. Taking stock of the experience and lessons of the last years this international co-operation can probably be improved further, and the fact that three currencies ot24 GJ countries have now merged in the euro could andshould make this co-operation easier, and more andrnore effective.In this perspective I would like to draw your attentionto four principles, which are key for internationalcooperation to be efficient._ the first principle we all have to stick to is the respect of the \ufffdotion that thc fundamentals are commanding the evolution of the exchange rates in the medium and long term. _ the second principle is the necessity to look for an appropriate consensus between the executive branch and monetary authorities and between the various countries concerned. - the third principle is the respect of what I would callverbal discipline. Markets _ can be troubled byheterogeneous and contradictory statements. On thecontrary they are impressed by the col)esion andcoherence of declarations sticking to joint 'terms ofreference'.- the fo\u00fcrth principle is the necessary preservation ofthe credibility of the authorities in all circumstances.25 ouring the last ten years the joint t,;ummuniques ofthe GVII signalling a joint message as regardsexchange rates have always been taken veryseriously by investors and markets, and proved to beefficient. This is a priceless asset that we mustcaretully preserve. As 8 conclusion, let me stress three points:As regards the European Central Bank and the European System of Central Banks, 1 would like tosuggest a melc:1\u00b5I ,o.-e which might bc cnlightening. ThP.rP. i\ufffd a monetarv team of Europe composed of twelve players, the ECB and the 11 National Central Banks. lt is the full monetary team of twelve which is playing on the field, with a single \"team spirit, esprit d'equipe\" which is one of the priceless assets of Europe. Secondly, as regards the present level of our interest rates, 1 would like to draw your attention to the foct that in all economies of thA Euro zone market rates are presently the lowest observed since World War II. The level of our long term rates in particular is impressively low and represents a major contribution to preserving growth and job creation. Our three month 26 rnoneY market rate in the Euro zone is presently 1 50basis points below the average rates observed inOctober 1997 and 95 basis points below average threerr,onth money market rates at the beginning of July19ga. The Euro is benefiting from the full legacy ofthe highest level of monetary credibility that had beengained over time in Europe. lt is our responsibility topreserve that credibility vis a vis investors and savers inEurope and in the world. lt is the only way to maintaina very favourable financial environment for the European economy.Thirdly, as regards the improvement of the financial architecture which is presently being discussed, 1 think it is important that we place ourselves in a situation which would permit national authorities, central banks, international financial institutions and surveillance bodies to cooperate actively and thereby keep permanently under review codes of good conduct, best practice and the core principles to be applied both at the macro level and at the micro level, with a view constantly to keeping up with rapid changes in technology, fin::mcial instruments and market practices. 1 would like to stress one point in particular, the specific dangers that are associated with the \"herd instinct n of operators, investors and markets. That \"herd behaviour\" has been observed during the last .18 months both as regards investors' attitudes vis a vis merging economies in transition and certainly alsoe arkets of the industrialised countries themselves. The\ufffderd instinct\" might be one of the worst enemieswhen we are aiming at global financial stability. In myopinion one of the best recipes for countering that herdbehaviour is full transparency of each particular entity,of each particutar country, of each particular borrower,of each particular signature. Only full and reliabletransparency tor all, both public and private sectorentities, permits a proper judgement of the merits ofeach case. \"Comparaison n'est pas raison\".1 hope all of us will be inspired by this motto. 28 :t<* TOT/'.i..
