Take, for example, the weekend edition of a weil respected of 16 November. One of the views expressed there was that- and I quote, \"ln Germany, nothing is going right. The government is boxed in by an inability to use monetary, fiscal or exchange rate policies to boost demand. Fear is growing that Germany will go the way of Japan, which has suffered 10 years of stagnation. The danger is that, like Japan, it would prefer to muddle through than take tough policy decisions. Germany is seen as a stricken giant, the sick man of Europe.\" Such comments soon give rise to the notion that Germany is on the edge of deflation. Tc say it straight out: that is not a view which I share. I do recognise the large number of problems that exist in Germany, but I do not perceive any deflation. ln other words, I do not expect the general price Ievei in Germany to decline on a Ieng-term basis and GDP to shrink over an extended period. We at the Bundesbank are forecasting a continuing Iew rate of inflation and a moderate increase in GDP in Germany for the coming year. While the price outlock is Page 2 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 gratifying, the prospects for growth are rather disappointing. I shall returntothat outlock and the subject of deflation in a few minutes' time. My simple proposition is that the outlock for Germany depends first and foremost on coping with the existing challenges to economic policy. ln order to gain a better understanding of this, however, we should first take a Iook back. A Iook back Taking that Iook back reveals that, since the reunification boom petered out, Germany has been one of a group of countries with weak growth. While the GDP of the present EMU countries has risen by a total of 15o/o since 1995, the corresponding figure for Germany is no more than 10%. ln line with this, the annual average rate of growth in Germany, at 1%%, has been lagging % percentage point behind. Comparing Germany with the euro area as a whole excluding Germany, in growth increases to over 1 percentage point. ln 2001, taken on its own, the figure was as much as 1% percentage points. the German shortfall ln my view, both temporary and Ieng-term factors have contributed to Germany's relatively poor performance in the euro area. As far as the temporary factors are concerned, it Page 3 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 should be remernbered that, already in the run-up to Stage Three of European monetary union, interest rates had fallen sharply in a number of EU countries with previously fairly high short and long-term rates of interest. For example, bonds in percentage points higher than interest rates for long-term government ltaly and Spain, even in 1995, were 5 to 6 the rates for German Federal Bonds. As the home of the former anchor currency in the ERM, Germany did not benefit directly from this process of interest rate convergence. Another cause of relatively weak growth in Germany is the crisis in the construction industry, especially in eastern Germany. ln this sector, the capacity built u~ immediately after reunification exceeded the Ionger-term ability of the real estate market to absorb it. Reduced depressed German economic growth. Without the decline in investment in construction activity construction since the mid-1990s, the shortfall in German growth compared with the euro area as a whole would therefore not have been as great. By contrast, construction activity in other European countries has remained an important mainstay of economic growth. Consideration also has to be given to the fact that living standards in the monetary union are still very disparate. Page 4 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 Since the poorer countries are supposed to catch up with the EMU average, they have to go on growing more strongly than those countries which have already achieved a high Ievei of income. One very important - if not the most important and reason for the inadequate pace of economic continuing - growth in Germany is the heavy burden of taxes and social security contributions. Added to this are strict regulations in some parts of the economy. Above all, there is too 'little labour market flexibility in Germany. ln periods of a cyclical downswing, in unemployment in Germany was far sharper than the fall rise the during periods when there was an upturn. For instance, the number of people out of werk in western Germany rose from its cyclical low point between 1991 and 1997 by some 1.3 million· to areund 2.5 million. By 2001, the number of unemployed had been reduced by no more than just over half a million. ln Germany, the incentives to take up employment are restriCted by the high-level marginal burden imposed by taxes and other public levies. Most types of hausehold in Germany have a marginal burden of taxes and levies of 50°/o or more. ln other words, from every additional euro that is earned, areund 50 cents are deducted. Moreover, Page 5 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 social benefits which are at a high Ievei by international standards act as a reservati0n wage. Many experts agree that the demand for labour in Germany also suffers from the very complex legal arrangements relating to werk contracts. Companies are so cautious in recruiting to make redundancies. labour because is so difficult it As you may know, the German Parliament adopted a labour market reform only a few days ago. lts main focus is on a more efficient placement of unemployed persans in jobs and an increase in temporary employment through personnel service agencies. These initial steps towards a reform of the labour market are, generally, tobe welcomed. However, there is a danger of regular jobs being replaced by subsidised ones. lf labour is not involved to a greater extent in the production it will be difficult in Germany to achieve a process, sustained high Ievei of growth again. An environment that is conducive to growth, however, also has to include a fiscal policy which Ieads to a lower tax burden. Page 6 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 Budgetary and consolidation policy ln the current year, Germany will considerably exceed both the 3% Iimit for the deficit ratio and the 60% debt ratio. Now, the Federal government has promised a package of measures which are designed to reverse the rapid deficit increase and to go back down below the 3% Iimit in the coming year. The volume of the package amounts to areund %% of GDP in the coming year. ln the years after that, it is envisaged that the volume will go up weil above 1% of GDP. final judgement on Making a the consolidation package is difficult. The proposed measures could still undergo changes in the course of the legislative the structure of process. I therefore wish to make only a somewhat more general assessment at this point. The measures in the package include reductions in the labour-market-related spending and tax changes. ln my lowering view, the initiatives on the expenditure side are heading in the right direction. Through the government spending, they are designed to reduce the burden of levies impeding growth in Germany. Cuts in subsidies and in labour-market-induced spending are especially conducive to improving the conditions for growth in the medium term. Page 7 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 While the spending cuts and the measures to increase revenues are intended to balance each other in the coming year, a distinctly greater role for the initiatives to increase revenue is envisaged for the years that follow. ln principle, it is true that broadening the tax basis and abolishing tax indeed be a part of a successful exemptions can consolidation policy. However, in the sense of a fundamental simplification of taxation - which is called for in Germany - a thoroughgoing reform would be desirable. This could embedded in a marked lowering of the tax rates. then also be What is more: the taxinitiatives by the German government are not just a matter of .abolishing exemptions. They also include interference in regulations that are quite justified from a taxation point of view. For example: restricting the possibilities of offsetting Iosses would end the correct symmetrical treatment of profits and Iosses under the tax system. This would make less investment projects attractive - especially those associated with higher risk er with strongly fluctuating earnings expectations . As I see it, when setting out the specific details of the • individual tax measures, particular attention should be paid to their impact on cerparate investment - something which is especially important for medium-term growth. Another point to consider is that the policy of enhancing the Page 8 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 attractiveness of private old-age provision and of Germany as a financial centre - should not be disrupted by a rise in the tax burden. Besides a reduction in the deficit ratio, it is also important not to lose sight of a lower overall burden of taxes and social security contributions. Above all, the high and rising social security contributions represent a significant obstacle to employment and growth. The comprehensive review of government activity and of state benefits which is needed has to include the social security sector too. ln this context, the tax reform that was adopted two years ago has brought some relief. The tax on retained profits was lowered from 40% to 30%. The top income taxrate will come down to 42% by 2005. And there has been some progress in Germany in the field of old-age pension provisions. The pension reform, which was adopted two objectives simultaneously. First, payments under the state pay-as last year, pursues you-go scheme are being cut back and, second, private pension provision strengthened. Pension increases over the next few years will remain below the Ievei of increases in wages and salaries. 1s being ·' Page 9 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 Macroeconomic assessment and outlook Ladies and Gentlemen, the cyclical worries in the global economy as weil as in Germany have undoubtedly increased once more in the course of this year. Since the spring, the economic climate in Germany has become cooler again. The slump in stock market prices and the rise in the cost of oil have played a major part in that. That development has been reinforced by the too high wage settlements in this year's pay round. We in Germany are thus clearly in a very difficult economic situation. The current slight improvement is still very fragile. That improvement is due primarily to external stimuli and influences from inventories. The \"cyclical breakthrough\" has therefore not been achieved yet. ln cyclical terms, we are still in the initial phase of an improvement that could quickly be put at risk again. Even so, the economy did grow somewhat in the ftrst three quarters of this year. Thanks to orders from abroad, exports have once again made a major contribution to growth. Owing to an increased number of car sales, private consumption has assisted growth. Page 10 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 ln cantrast to this, fixed capital formation is still putting a firm brake on growth. That applies not only to buildings but. also to machinery and equipment. Although capacity utilization has picked up somewhat from its low at the start of this year, it continues to be significantly down on the normal Ievei of capacity utilisation. Added to the problems in the corporate sector are financing conditions which, on the whole, have become more difficult. ln the corporate sector there is great uncertainty about future profits. lf one Iooks - by way of an example - at enterprises listed on the stock market, analysts have now made a considerable downward revision of their medium term growth forecasts for corporate profits. But even the down-revised assessments expectation of a distinct recovery in profits. remain based on the The labour market has come even more heavily under pressure since the summer. lt has been less and less the case the in manufacturing and redundancies that construction sector have been offset by a positive development in services. Economic activity is still too weak to relieve the labour market. Taking tagether all the data that are currently available, the economy as a whole cannot be expected to improve in the immediate future. The rate of GDP growth for 2002 will be below%%. Page 11 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 As things appear at present, the outlock for 2003 is, in fact, somewhat better overall. But many forecasts point to downside risks. There might be cause for some optimism in a return to greater stability on the stock markets and if eil prices were to settle down at their present Ievei. That would mean that risk premia on the financial markets could go back to normal again. That would underlying monetary conditions to come into operation. then allow the favourable Finally, there might be some hope in the passing of the phenomenon of \"perceived\" inflation. Admittedly, not a great deal of momentum can be expected from all of the • cited factors. The underlying pace of economic growth will remain subdued in the first half of next year. When exports gain the negative confidence effects on momentum and investment and consumption peter out, the upturn from the secend half of 2003 onwards will be somewhat strenger and more broadly based. However, given the high degree of uncertainty and unused capacity, we expect no improvement in investment activity in the near future. We believe that investment activity will not take a turn for the better until the secend half of next Page 12 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 year. Experience of investment behaviour in the past may ' be a further indication that the pick-up of investment in machinery and equipment will be modest. As regards investment in construction, leading indicators show that the downward adjustment process has not come to an end and is likely to continue in the near future. As I said at the very beginning, the outlock for inflation is much better than the outlock for growth. But before I turn to the price-side ·of the German economy, I would like to conclude my remarks on the real side of the economy with a few sentences on Germany's expert performance. Real world market shares of Germany Recently, there have been repeated references to a sharp decline in German world market shares since the beginning of the 1990s, and this has been regarded as indicating Germany's the competitiveness. Iack of lndeed, development of world market shares may be misleading - if conventionally calculated on the basis of nominal foreign trade values in national currencies, which have been con verted by current exchange rates into US dollars - whenever there are significant exchange rate movements of the dollar. Page 13 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 Thus, a depreciation of the euro against the US dollar, if considered in isolation, necessarily results in a fall in Germany's world market shares, even if its real market shares actually remain constant. To avoid these distortions it seems reasonable to calculate real world market shares, which are by definition adjusted for changes in inflation dif ferentials and exchange rates. ln centrast to the nominal world market shares, Germany's t real shares have shown a significant increase since the mid-1990s. Germany's share of global exports rose from 9 % in 1995 to 10 % at the end of 2001 and thereby regained the position held in the early 1990s. This upturn reflects, in particular, the improved price competitiveness of Germany's industry. Germany's retrieval of its former position on the world market since the mid-1990s becomes even clearer if the country's export performance is considered in relation to the other industrial countries and therefore account is taken of the fact that the industrial countries as a whole have been losing market shares to the ernerging markets. industrial countries has lf viewed in this context, the German share of the real increased by exports of the 2% percentage points since 1995. At just under 16%, Germahy's share exceeded recently even its old record Ieveis from the late 80s. Page 14 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 The debate on deflation ln all probability, the German inflation rate will remain at a low Ievei next year too. Germany is among the countries with the lowest inflation rate in the euro area. Such a development is often interpreted,· in itself, as signifying ·a risk of deflation. Same in German consumer prices analysts are already detecting conditions in Germany similar to those in Japan. ln cantrast to that, I can see the low inflation rate as having advantages for a cyclical recovery. Price stability is bolstering households' disposable income. That is all the more important since the burden of taxes and social security contributions on households is set to increase noticeably next year. Furthermore, the labour market will be overshadowed by slow economic growth for some time to come yet. So far, in Germany there are no signs of any price restraint expectation-induced in private consumption. Exactly in view of Germany's long-standing stability culture, the idea that the expectation of higher inflation rates should have a growth-enhancing effect seems to me to be unrealistic anyway. ln terms of labour costs as weil, there are no grounds in in other words, a Germany for a deflationary spiral - Page 15 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 general and Ieng Iasting price slump combined with self perpetuating recessionary pressure. This year's pay round has more than exhausted the real scope for income distribution. Finally, it should be borne in mind that the ECB, in quantifying price stability, has factored in not only price measurement problems but also a safety margin from the deflationary zone. What is making the deflation theory so popular in Germany at the moment is, I believe, weak potentia1 growth. lf potential growth is weak, even small disturbances can Iead to very low growth rates or, in fact, to absolute declines in overall output. Looked at in that way, recessionary periods become more likely if potential growth is low. At the same time, the pressure on economic policymakers increases. When deflationary risks are under discussion in Germany, is soon attention focused on monetary policy. Seme economists claim that the ECB's policy is not expansionary enough for Germany. lt is argued that real ·interest rates are higher in Germany than in many . other euro area countries because of our low rate of inflation. I believe, however, that it is not sufficient to Iook at real into interest consideration at least two other factors. First of all, it has to isolation. We have rates take to in Page 16 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 be pointed out that the relatively low inflation rate in Germany results in a real depreciation within the euro area. By itself, this Ieads to increased competitiveness on the part of the German economy. Second, with regard to wage rate policy, we repeatedly have to make clear that the rate of inflation in Germany is lower tha_n the euro-area average. The more that fact is taken into account in collective wage negotiations, the lower will be the risk of deflationary tendencies. Financial markets ln the discussions on deflationary risks in Germany, the question of the stability of the German financial system is always raised as weil. lt is argued that while, in the US, households are bearing the brunt of declining asset prices, in Germany a wide range of financial institutions are being affected by the deterioration in asset ·prices and credit quality. Allow me to make four comments on that. My first remark concerns households. According to our own estimate, a 30% decline in equity prices dampens GDP .by between 0.1 and 0.2 percentage point as a result of a fall in private consumption. This is much lower than estimates for the US. The difference is mainly due to the fact that, in Germany, only 20% to . 25% of equities are held by Page 17 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 households. The volume of total shares outstanding in relation to GDP is weil below the US figure. Second, I would like to point to the fact that a declin·e in equity prices also has an effect on corporate finance. ln Germany, however, only 5% to 7°/o of the financial needs of the corporate sector are covered by the equity market. Nevertheless, access to the bond market has also become more difficult for some enterprises owing to the fact that their credit rating has declined. For some firms, the high risk premium on corporate bonds has pushed up financing costs. Since German non-financial enterprises obtain no more through bonds, than about 2% of their funds however, no severe problems are to be expected on that front either. German companies rely mainly on bank loans. And bank loans to the domestic private sector have shown hardly any further increase during the past few months. ln September, they were only 1% up year over year. ln actual fact, there are some indications that banks are showing a certain amount of restraint in their lending. ln addition to narrow margins in lending business, the very high number of business insolvencies and the fact that many enterprises have a low Ievel of capital is likely to Page 18 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 have played a part in this. The quality of banks' loan portfolios has deteriorated. However, our empirical studies have c;~lso clearly revealed that the cause of the weak credit growth in Germany lies not so much in the banks' behaviour as in the situation of the economy as a whole. This means that the marked slowdown in credit expansion is mainly the outcome of a cyclically induced subdued demand for credit. ln my view, the currently weak development of credit cannot therefore be cited as evidence of a general credit crunch in Germany. Allow me now to come to my third point and make a few remarks on the insurance companies. The insurance sector in Germany is one of the most important institutional investors. ln June 2002, the financial assets of to almest the entire sector amounted 1 000 billion at book values. More than one-third of that amount was invested in the capital markets. By far the largest part of that figure was invested by life insurance companies, which - at the end of the first half of 2002 - had equities (excluding participating interests) and mutual fund shares to the amount of 160 billion. Life Page 19 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 insurance companies have invested 20% of their financial assets in equities. The fact that share prices have now fallen by araund 60% from their peak in March 2000 has led to a significant fall in insurance companies' overall earnings and thus also to a reduction in capital bonuses for policyholders. So far, however, this has not generated any destabilising effects an the capital market. Even in 2002, insurance companies have still been making new investments of araund 12 billion net in equities and mutual fund shares. Moreover, the insurance companies have a major self interest in protecting the entitlements of their clients. They have has therefore established a rescue company for failing institutions, although - up to now - this company has not had to take any action. The extensive depreciation requirements due to the significant shares Iosses have been mitigated by legislation providing tax accounting relief. Fourth, I would now like to take a Iook at the German banks. The decline in the equity market has led to a reduction in the amount of hidden reserves. The growth weakness of the German economy is reflected, above all, in a high risk provision requirement for domestic Page 20 of 21Deutsche Bundesbank, 26.11.2002 lending business. Added to this are Iew earnings from commission business and own-account trading. All of this has hit a banking system where, for structural reasons, margins an~ comparatively narrow anyway. By rnternational Standards, the German banking sector is characterised by a Iew degree of concentration as weil as very streng competition. ln my view, it is not justified to say there is a banking crisis in Germany. There is no liquidity crisis. German banks are not facing a massive non-performing loan problern as are banks in Japan. And there is no real-estate bubble in Germany. Above all we have to take into account that the German banks are currently taking comprehensive measures to improve their profitability. These measures concern, first of all, the cost side. The planned staffing adjustments will bring a significant easing of the situation. ln addition to that, the process of consolidation which has been under way for some time among smaller banks will gain in momentum. And, finally, the German banking industry is showing a heightened risk awareness at present. All of these factors tagether are likely to give a renewed boost to earning power and thus reinforce the stability of the German banking system. Page 21 of21"}
