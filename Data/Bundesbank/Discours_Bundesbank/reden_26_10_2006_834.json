But \nwhat is actually meant by the term ﬁcentral bank in\ndependenceﬂ? In this \ncontext, it refers to four different aspects of the\n special institutional ar-\nrangement which characterises the ESCB.  \nFirst and foremost, the most important aspect of ce\nntral bank independence \nin the euro area is that the central banks of the E\nSCB are independent of \npolitical instructions, an aspect referred to as in\nstitutional independence \n[laid \ndown in Article 108 of the Treaty establishing the \nEuropean Community]\n. Neither the \nECB nor the national central banks, nor any member \nof their decision-\nmaking bodies are allowed to seek or take instructi\nons from Community in-\nstitutions or from any government \n[Art. 108 of the Treaty, first sentence]\n. \nIn turn, the Community institutions and member stat\nes™ governments also \nhave to respect this principle and must not seek to\n influence the decision-\nmaking bodies of the ECB or the national central ba\nnks \n[Art. 108 of the Treaty, \nsecond sentence]\n. \nThis fundamental principle insulates the decision-m\naking bodies of the \nESCB from undue political influence while carrying \nout the tasks and duties \nconferred upon them by the Treaty.", "Embargo: October 26, 2006, 11.00 am local time\n  Page 6 of 19 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communication Ł Wilhelm-Epstei\nn-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bund\nesbank.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 6\n9 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n The second aspect is that of personal independence.\n Governors of the na-\ntional central banks are appointed for at least a f\nive-year term of office, \nmembers of the ECB™s executive board for an eight-y\near term (with no pos-\nsibility of reappointment). In addition, members of\n the Governing Council \ncannot be recalled for political reasons. \nBoth arrangements limit the possibility of exerting\n political pressure on indi-\nvidual members of the Governing Council and, indire\nctly, on the council as \na whole. \nThe third aspect is that the central banks of the E\nurosystem are also inde-\npendent in financial terms. This means that they ar\ne not dependent on \nfunds being provided to them by other institutions \nin their respective coun-\ntries. This also helps to protect central banks fro\nm political pressure that \nmight otherwise be placed on them, for example, by \nlimiting the banks™ fi-\nnancial capabilities. \n\nFinally, the fourth aspect of central bank independ\nence in the ESCB is func-\ntional independence.

The r\neason for this nexus is that \nunsound fiscal policies generally entail the risk o\nf a conflict between mone-\ntary and budget policy. \n\nGiven high levels of public debt and associated hig\nh interest rate expenses, \nit cannot be ruled out that politicians will tend t\no exert pressure on the cen-\ntral bank in order to make it lower the real burden\n of public debt by easing \nmonetary policy and, thus, allowing inflation to ri\nse. \nAlthough, in general, central bank independence cou\nntervails undue politi-\ncal influence, it does not itself solve the potenti\nal for conflict which can harm \nthe credibility of monetary policy. Consequently, f\niscal discipline is not only a \ncomplementary condition of monetary stability, but \nalso of overall macro-\neconomic stability. \n\nGiven the potential problems associated with fiscal\n imbalances, the avoid-\nance of excessive deficits represents an essential \nprerequisite for the main-", "Embargo: October 26, 2006, 11.00 am local time\n  Page 10 of 19 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communication Ł Wilhelm-Epstei\nn-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bund\nesbank.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 6\n9 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n tenance of fiscal policies conducive to monetary an\nd overall macroeconomic \nstability.  \n\nThe need for sound fiscal policies is especially ev\nident in a monetary union \nif negative spill-over effects from one member stat\ne™s budget to the rest of \nthe union are to be avoided.  \n\nThis is the rationale behind the existence of the e\nxcessive deficit procedure \nŒ laid down in the Treaty establishing the European\n Community and further \nclarified in the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) Œ \nwhich aims to limit the \nrisks to price stability that might otherwise arise\n from national fiscal policies. \nFinally, having outlined the importance of sound fi\nscal policies, I would like \nto emphasise that central bank independence contrib\nutes most effectively to \nmonetary stability when it is supported by an overa\nll stability consensus \namong the general public. \n\nThis has been the case in Germany for many decades.\n Political attempts to \nundermine the Bundesbank™s independence and its pur\nsuit of price stability \nhave been repeatedly rejected by the public. \n\nLet me give you one famous example, namely the publ\nic reaction to a \nspeech in 1956 by the then Federal Chancellor, Konr\nad Adenauer.", "Embargo: October 26, 2006, 11.00 am local time\n  Page 11 of 19 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communication Ł Wilhelm-Epstei\nn-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bund\nesbank.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 6\n9 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n In what became known as his ﬁguillotine speechﬂ, Ad\nenauer criticised the \npolicy of the Bank deutscher Länder Œ the forerunne\nr of the present-day \nBundesbank Œ following the Bank™s decision to conti\nnue a restrictive mone-\ntary course.  \n\nAdenauer described the Bank™s decision as ﬁ\na heavy blow – struck at the \nGerman economy, and it is the little ones who will \nsuffer most – the guillo-\ntine falls on the average man in the street, and th\nat is what grieves me so \nmuch.\nﬂ  \nHowever, the response in Germany was highly damagin\ng to Adenauer.

In my view\n, quite the opposite is \ntrue; in actual fact, maintaining price stability i\ns the best contribution which \nmonetary policy can make to sustained economic grow\nth and job creation. \nLet me explain the main reason for this conclusion.\n A monetary policy \ngeared towards price stability reduces the level an\nd variability of inflation \nand, thus, facilitates the efficient allocation of \nresources, which is the basis \nof any sustained economic development. \n\nIn addition to this main benefit, maintaining price\n stability also minimises \nother negative effects that accompany inflation. To\n show this, let me briefly \nelaborate on the costs of inflation, which will cle\narly explain why price stabil-\nity should be monetary policy™s primary objective. \n\nFirst, inflation distorts the price mechanism. In a\n market-driven economy, \nfreely moving market prices are the key signals tha\nt indicate scarcity of \ngoods and services. By indicating scarcity, relativ\ne market prices help to al-\nlocate economic resources to the most productive ut\nilisation. \nInflation, however, distorts this mechanism since t\nhe rapid increase of the \ngeneral price level blurs the signal function of th\ne movement in relative \nprices. As a result, resource allocation becomes su\nboptimal, with negative \nrepercussions for growth and development.", "Embargo: October 26, 2006, 11.00 am local time\n  Page 16 of 19 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communication Ł Wilhelm-Epstei\nn-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bund\nesbank.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 6\n9 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n Second, inflation induces unintentional effects on \nthe distribution of income \nand wealth. Experience has shown that the holders o\nf financial assets are \nparticularly severely hit by the erosion of the val\nue of money. Their inflation \nlosses are accompanied by matching undeserved and p\nurely arbitrary gains \naccruing to debtors.  \nThere are many indications that a considerable numb\ner of ﬁsmall saversﬂ, in \nparticular, are not fully in a position to protect \nthemselves against inflation-\ninduced financial losses. Hence, price stability fu\nlfils a crucial social func-\ntion: It protects the ﬁman on the streetﬂ, in parti\ncular, from being gradually \ndispossessed by creeping inflation. \n\nFinally, inflation acts as an additional tax. In mo\nst countries, tax systems are \nbased on nominal values Œ in other words, these sys\ntems are not adjusted \nto a rise in the price level. \nIn such systems, inflation has the effect of an add\nitional tax on investment \nand labour income and produces considerable wealth \nlosses. The main rea-\nson for this is that, in addition to ﬁnormal taxati\nonﬂ, inflation drives a further \nwedge between the real yield before tax and after t\nax. Inflation therefore \ncauses the effective tax burden to increase, a proc\ness referred to as ﬁcold \nprogressionﬂ. \n\nThus, inflation has significant adverse repercussio\nns not only for growth, but \nalso for income distribution in a society.", "Embargo: October 26, 2006, 11.00 am local time\n  Page 17 of 19 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communication Ł Wilhelm-Epstei\nn-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bund\nesbank.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 6\n9 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n In this context, another important consensus has em\nerged over the past \ndecades. In the long run, there is no trade-off bet\nween low inflation and high \nemployment Œ as a naïve interpretation of the Phill\nips curve might suggest. \nA society cannot simply choose to have lower long-t\nerm unemployment at \nthe cost of rising inflation. \nHistory has shown that many of the countries that h\nave tried to exploit this \nalleged connection eventually experienced both: hig\nh inflation and high un-\nemployment. \nThus, low inflation and not high inflation, is cond\nucive to fostering sustained \neconomic growth and job creation. \n4 Concluding remarks \nI would like to sum up as follows: central bank ind\nependence is not an end \nin itself. As a matter of fact, such independence i\ns, instead, a precondition \nfor a stability-oriented monetary policy and helps \nto enhance its credibility.
