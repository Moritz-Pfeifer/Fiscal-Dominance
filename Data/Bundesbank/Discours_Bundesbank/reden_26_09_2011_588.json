The American Council on Ge\nrmany was founded in 1952 in order to \nencourage reconciliation and understanding between Germany and North America following the two world wars in the first half of the twentieth century. To this day, it has the objective of enhancing transatlantic understanding.\n This is still very import\nant as we are experiencing \nfast and significant changes. The headwinds gener\nated by the global financial crisis are still being felt and on both sides of the Atlantic a rethinking of old certainties is underway. In \nsuch a situation, it is crucial to exchange ideas, re-examine the perceptions we have of ourselves and of one another and foster mutual understanding. With this in mind, I would like to talk about Germany™s role in the global economy, which, of course, is closely \nconnected to its role as a member of European Monetary Union. \nOne thing that people often associate with Germany is its export strength. And the export sector certainly has traditionally played an impor\ntant role in the German economy. However,", "Page 3 of 11 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n the German economy has not always performed as solidly as it is doing now. The past two decades have seen changing patterns in Germany™s economic performance, with a major structural weakness following the boom of \nreunification and an arduous but ultimately successful process of reform in the years that followed.  \nAs popular as individual German export pr\noducts are globally, Germany sometimes faces the reproach that its export strength comes at the expense of gl\nobal stability. Critics either imply that Germany promotes imbalances at a global level or\n within the euro area or that it should have done more to bolster global demand. \nAs I will outline in more detail during this speech, the difficult but ultimately successful adjustment that Germany has undergone in the past has enabled it to serve as an important buffer for global demand during the crisis and an indispensable anchor of stability within EM\nU, both throughout the crisis and during the subsequent recovery. In order to clarify these points, I will concentrate on the following three aspects:  First, I will shed some light on the underlying \nfactors behind persistent divergences in price competitiveness within the euro area, which, together with pas\nt fiscal profligacy, are to a large part responsible for the problem\ns we are facing today. In particular, I will illustrate how those member states whose competitiveness has deteriorated substantially since monetary union have not managed to take advantage of it.   Second, I will describe Germany's economic\n performance during the crisis and the recovery. In particular, I will show how Germany served as an import buffer during the economic downturn that followed the financial crisis. Now that many countries are struggling with recovery, the more dynamic upswing in Germany is providing an \nimportant impetus to the rest of Europe.", "Page 4 of 11 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n  Finally, I will turn to the challenges that t\nhe European sovereign debt crisis is posing to \nGermany. Considering that Germany is providing a large part of the fiscal contributions to euro area countries with refinancing problems, confidence in Germany™s solvency is vitally important in the current situation. Germany therefore has to set an example for implementing sound fiscal policies within the euro area. Howeve\nr, this alone will not be \nsufficient to resolve the sovereign debt cris\nis. To secure long-run stability within EMU, \nsignificantly stronger incentives for s\nound public finances are indispensible. \n2 Intra-EMU divergences \nWhat critics actually have in mind when they talk about Germany™s export strength is the existence of current account surpluses which contrast with current account deficits in other \nEMU member states or other countries around the world. I would like to emphasise that neither current account surpluses nor current account deficits are a bad thing per se. Current account surpluses reflect net foreign lending and current account deficits net foreign borrowing, and depending on the circumstances, both can be appropriate for a given country. For a country with a declining working-age population, for example, it is quite reasonable for residents to save money for the future and to invest a share of it abroad. By compensating for a shrinking income in the future, the money saved today allows consumption to be smoothed over time. Conversely, countries which are undergoing a catch-up process and need financing for the investments might be willing and promising borrowers of foreign funds.  Consequently, for a proper assessment we have to take a closer look at the underlying drivers of current account surpluses in some euro-area countries and of current account", "Page 5 of 11 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n deficits in others. One worrying development is that divergences in current account balances have mostly gone hand in hand with divergences in price competitiveness. Whereas Germany, as a surplus country, has been able to improve its price competitiveness significantly since the launch of the euro, the \ncurrent account deficits in Greece, Spain and Portugal and to a lesser extent in Ireland were\n accompanied by significant losses in price \ncompetitiveness: The lower interest rates brought about by monetary union and inflowing capital had partly fuelled unsustainable developments, such as excessive credit dynamics and real estate bubbles in Spain or excessive\n fiscal spending in Greece. The resulting domestic boom and existing labour market rigiditi\nes led to large wage increases well in \nexcess of productivity growth, triggering a loss in price competitiveness and thereby impairing export performance. Current account deficits were therefore ultimately a symptom of countries living beyond their means. The defic\nits will only decline if ambitious and often painful adjustments are undertaken that bring these economies back on a sustainable track. What about Germany? At first sight, Germany™s gain in price competitiveness since \nmonetary union seems quite large. \nHowever, it is important to bear in mind that this increase \nfollowed a period of rather weak economic performance in the 1990s after Germany™s reunification boom. The most recent competitiveness gains and the resulting impulse for exports were the consequence of a painful \nbut necessary and ultimately successful adjustment process. An important part of this \nprocess was a restructuring in the corporate sector, which significantly enhanced \nthe profitability of firms. In addition, there were major and long overdue policy reforms, namely labour market reforms, fiscal consolidation and adjustments in the social security systems. Consequently, and in contrast to some other \nsurplus countries, Germany™s current account surpluses were certainly not caused by policy interventions aimed at boosting exports. Instead, they resulted from market-driven adjustments to external pressure as well as overdue structural reforms. It is true that the", "Page 6 of 11 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n restructuring process has fostered the emergence of current account surpluses by putting a strain on domestic consumption. As the restructuring process was temporary, however, German current account surpluses are not expected to reach pre-crisis levels soon again. \nIn addition, Germany™s experience should prov\nide some reassurance to those countries faced with the need to restore their competit\niveness: Structural reforms can initiate necessary adjustments and will pay off in the end Œ thanks to its reforms, the German economy was much stronger in the years preceding the crisis than before. 3 Economic spillovers during the crisis and the recovery \nNot least for this reason, Germany was able to serve as an anchor for stability within EMU throughout the crisis as well as in the current recovery. Because of it\ns export strength, the German economy was affected particularly strongly by the global economic downturn that was triggered by the financial crisis. However,\n as this shock hit the German economy in a phase of structural strength and was only temporary, the negative effects were contained. From today™s perspective we know that Germany has weathered the economic crisis comparatively well. The labour market was only weakly affected as firms \nin the export sector chose to reduce working time over staff layoffs, whereas the domestic economy was less affected and even continued to increase employment. Now unemployment rates are even \nlower than before the crisis. In addition, Germany profited from its previous consolidation efforts. The almost balanced fiscal budget at the beginning of the crisis allowed scope for implementing sizeable fiscal stimulus programmes. As a consequence, private consumption remained robust throughout the crisis, which explains why Germany was able to serve as an important buffer for world demand at the height of the financial crisis. In fact, the huge", "Page 7 of 11 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n downturn in the German economy was largely \ndriven by a decline in exports: about two thirds of the downswing can be attributed to a negative contribution from foreign trade.  Having experienced a disproportionately strong decline during the crisis, exports in Germany have also benefited disproportionately from the revival of global economic activity. So far, Germany has undergone a sound process of recovery. Economic activity has almost returned to its pre-crisis level and the output gap has been cl\nosed, indicating that the recovery process is at an advanced stage. The \nrecovery is also broader-based than in past cycles. The positive labour market situati\non and the improved real wages and income expectations of private households are supporting growth in consumption, which had already been resilient throughout \nthe crisis. And even though spillover effects from growth in Germany to other countries are comparatively low, Germany still serves as an important transmitter of the impulses from global \ndemand to other EU member states.  Most recently, the German economic outlook has been dampened by high overall uncertainty, especially regarding further \ndevelopments in the European sovereign debt crisis. But we expect economic activity to remain robust in the third quarter, and even though expectations for the winter months are subject to considerable risks, this should \nprove to be more of a soft patch. Nevertheless, there is a heightened danger that financial market turmoil affects the real economy. Thus, it is crucial to find a prompt and consistent political answer to the sovereign debt cr\nisis in order to reduce downside risks.", "Page 8 of 11 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n 4 Fiscal discipline and the European sovereign debt crisis  \nIn addition to its robust economic conditions, \nGermany is an anchor of stability within EMU through the high level of confidence in the sustainability of its public finances as well as through its financial support to those countries within EMU which currently lack this confidence. \nWhile Germany profited from its public finances being in comparatively good shape at the beginning of the crisis, the economic downturn and necessary rescue measures for banks during the crisis have put a serious strain on the national budget. The debt ratio increased \nby 19 pp to 84% of GDP between 2007 and 2010, mostly due to the support for the financial sector. Given the experience from the sovereign debt crisis, it is imperative to sustain confidence in public finances. This requires cr\nedible consolidation efforts now and not just \nsome kind of commitment to future steps.  The debt brake, which Germany has enshrined in its constitution, is principally a good means of achieving this objective, as it legally binds politicians to obtaining sound public finances. Germany has therefore set an important example within EMU and I welcome the aspirations in France, Spain, Portugal and Ita\nly to follow this example. This is an acknowledgement to the importance of sound fiscal policy. However, the effectiveness of \nnational debt brakes will depend on their specific\n design and in the case of Germany on the \ncondition that the debt brake is applied according to its rules. As important as effective national debt brakes are, they\n are not sufficient to solve the current sovereign debt crisis within the euro area. To achieve this, we need an effective policy \nframework that meets the requirements stemming from the unique nature of EMU. EMU is a", "Page 9 of 11 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n monetary union between sovereign states, not a federal state with a common budget. This is a fundamental difference compared for example to the United States. It means that euro area countries decide independently about their fiscal policy, but that the high indebtedness of one country affects all of the member states because of its effects on the common monetary policy. This harbour\ns the danger of weakening incentives for sound public finances as the individual countries no longer \ncarry the full burden of high sovereign debt by \nthemselves. Ultimately, this could even translate into pressure on monetary policy to ease the burden of high public debt, for example by a more expansionary monetary policy or by using central banks™ balance sheets to shift burdens among member states. In order to correct for these adverse effects, Eur\nopean Monetary Union was \nfounded on a stability-\noriented policy framework. This framework includes legal provisions that preclude monetary \nfinancing of governments, strict\n fiscal rules laid down in t\nhe Stability and Growth Pact and the ﬁno bail-outﬂ clause, which, by ensuring that each country ultimately has to bear the consequences of its own fiscal policy, is an indispensible prerequisite for sound public \nfinances within the euro area. The severity of the sovereign debt crisis in\n some member states and the imminent risks of \ncontagion for other member states, however, have threatened financial stability within the \nEuropean Monetary Union as a whole. The European Council theref\nore agreed that financial assistance should be granted to countries with severe refinancing problems, a substantial part of which is provided by Germany. This financial support is intended to buy time for the affected countries to conduct necessary structural reforms and implement consolidation measures in order to regain market participants™ confidence in the soundness of their public finances and their competitiveness. The assi\nstance is therefore bound to adjustment programmes, which each recipient country has to fulfil.", "Page 10 of 11 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n However, the reduction of interest pay\nments on the financial aid has weakened the incentives for countries in an adjustment programme to re-establish sound public finances \nvia fiscal and economic reforms and return \nto the capital market. Furthermore, the conditionality of the support measures has been loosened by the recent decisions of July \n21st. This weakens the underlying principle of European Monetary Union that each country has to bear the full consequences of its own fisca\nl policy. Contrary to what is actually needed in order to overcome the sovereign debt crisis, we risk seeing the propensity for excessive deficits rise even further in the fu\nture. Germany™s debate about the way forward in the crisis is therefore motivated by a serious concern for the stability of monetary union.  \nWe will not be able to regain stability within EMU without re-establishing the credibility of its \nframework. A fundamental political decision is\n therefore needed: eit\nher the existing policy \nframework of EMU has to be changed fundamentally or the incentives for sound fiscal policy have to be strengthened within the existing framework. The first option would imply EMU member states abandoning a substantial part of their national sovereignty over fiscal policy \nand would therefore require fundamental legal changes on \nthe European and possibly also the national level. The second option requires a return to t\nhe fundamental principles of monetary union, with each member state bearing the consequences of its own fiscal policy \ndecisions. Either option would be sustainable from an economic point of view. However, \ncombining elements of both options, ie sharing the risks of unsound fiscal policy and retaining national sovereignty over fiscal po\nlicy, is condemned to failure. It would undermine \nthe incentives for sound fiscal and economic \npolicy even further, thus achieving the opposite \nof stabilising monetary union. Ult\nimately, this approach would also not be credible to \nfinancial markets as its inconsistencies raise doubts about the public and political support.", "Page 11 of 11 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n 5 Conclusion  \nLet me conclude my speech on Germany™s role in the global economy wit\nh some caveats. In spite of the rather favourable performance during the crisis, Germany faces major challenges, overcoming the euro ar\nea™s sovereign debt crisis being the most pressing. In addition, the level of public debt has risen substantially throughout the crisis. Consequently, and considering the increasing fiscal burdens caused by an ageing society and a shrinking working-age population, consolidation is a major task for Germany, too. It is indispensible to \nensure the long-term sustainabilit\ny of its public finances.  But unlike some other EMU member states, Germany is still in a relatively favourable position. This combined with t\nhe fact that Germany continues to be an important economic player despite global shifts in economic weight\ns is due, not least, to painful but ultimately rather successful structural reforms undertaken in the past. It would be short-sighted to rely solely on these achievements. But they could \nwell serve as an encouragement to reform-minded policymakers in other countries. And the fact that these reforms, including the emphasis on fiscal soundness, contributed to revitalising the German economy and to \nincreasing its resilience should not be a cause fo\nr concern or complaint. Instead, it should be seen as good news Œ for Germany, but al\nso for EMU and the global economy. *    *    *"], "SECTION": "reden", "RECORD_ID": 588}
