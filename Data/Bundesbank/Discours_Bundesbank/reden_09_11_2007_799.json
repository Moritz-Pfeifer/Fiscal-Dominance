But I think that, looking back \nover the past two days, listening to a\nll your contributions has clearly been \nworthwhile. \n \nOne of the issues we \ntouched upon was ﬁWhat kind\n of research should \ncentral banks conduct?ﬂ. Here, opinions\n might differ. There is no doubt, \nhowever, that for a decentralised \nsystem like the Eu\nrosystem, pooling \nresearch efforts and organising conf\nerences like this one with our \ncolleagues from Finland is a course \nthat we should follow and will be \nfollowing more closely in\n the future. Therefore, I want to thank the \norganisers at both the \nBundesbank and Suomen Pankki for matching such \nan impressive number of outstanding\n researchers with \na well-focused and \nstructured programme. Particularly, I would like to thank the organisers \nHeinz Hermann and David Mayes for t\nheir formidable effort and success in \nputting this event together. \n \nAs my final introductory remark, allo\nw me thank our conference staff. As \nusual, it has mastered the whole range \nof logistical and operational issues \nbehind the scenes.  2 Current challenges for monetary policy \nForrest Capie started his paper (ﬁSom\ne scattered thoughts from history on \nevolution and design in central bankingﬂ) \non the history of\n central banking \nby asking whether there \nis anything left to say.\n In the past few days, \npresentations and discussions have cl\nearly shown that there are still \nimportant challenges in terms of t\nhe nitty-gritty business of central \nbanking. This holds true despite all \nthe documented progress in central", "Embargo: 9 November, 2007, 05:30 p.m. local time \n  Page 3 of 8 banking concerning the trend towards \nindependent central banks, and the \nwidespread consensus on the merits \nof price stabilit\ny as a primary \nobjective of monetary policy. \n \nBut a historical \ntour de table\n as provided by Forrest Capie and Alex \nCukierman (in his paper ﬁCentral \nbank independence and \nmonetary policy \nmaking institutions Œ past, present \nand futureﬂ) serves an important \npurpose. It reminds us that, for co\nlleagues who have experienced at least \none complete cycle in monetary theor\ny, what some younger colleagues \ncall a current challenge is, in fact, ju\nst a forgotten lesson from the past. I \ntherefore certainly agree with him that it is useful for us to be reminded of \nan old truth.  Forrest Capie identified two core pur\nposes in the history of central \nbanking: price and financial stability. T\nhe focus in the nineteenth century \nwas financial stability and in the twentieth century the focus changed to \n\nprice stability. For most central \nbanks, price stability has become the \nprimary objective. It is well accepted now\nadays that inflation is ultimately a \nmonetary phenomenon and that there is no long-run trade-off between \noutput and inflation. \n \nThus, central bank independence became \nsomething of a ﬁgreat mantraﬂ \nin the twentieth century. \nBut this seems to be no reason for politicians to \ncall into question the independence of \ncentral banks from time to time. \nPublic backing of the \ncentral bank™s quest for price stability is \nindispensable for a sustained culture of\n low inflation. And, in an era of \nhistorically low inflation rates, the dam\naging effects of inflation might easily \nbe forgotten. One of the current cha\nllenges facing central banks is to \nuphold public acceptance for achieving price stability. \n 2.1 Price stability as \nthe primary objective \nPrice stability and ou\ntput stabilisation One closely related aspect in this \ncontext was pointed out by Alex \nCukierman in his comprehensive su\nrvey on central bank independence: \nonce the public becomes a\nccustomed to low inflati\non rates, it is quite \nconceivable that central banks feel \nmore inclined to concentrate their \ninstruments on other goals, such as stabilising output. \n \nI do not want to dig too deeply into this\n issue, but just focus on what Œ in \nmy view Œ seems to be a fair account\n of the existing \nliterature. While \nglobalisation has had some impact on inflat\nion in industrialised countries, it \nis certainly a more stability-orient\ned monetary policy that deserves the \nmain credit for the decline in inflat\nion rates worldwide over the past 15 \nyears.", "Embargo: 9 November, 2007, 05:30 p.m. local time \n  Page 4 of 8 Then, however, we should be highly sceptical about interpretations based \non reduced form estimates of flatter Ph\nillips curves indicating a possibly \nmore lax attitude towards risks to in\nflation. Because not reacting in a \ntimely manner in the face of those ri\nsks entails the danger that the very \nreasons for a seemingly more beni\ngn inflationary impact of shocks Œ \nsolidly anchored inflation expectations\n due to improved \nmonetary policy Œ \nare jeopardised. This would entail a loss of credibility.  \nGiven the clear mandate of\n the Eurosystem, the Gove\nrning Council has to take into account the increased inflati\non risks. At the current juncture, the \nsharp increase of inflation Œ due to\n high oil and food prices, along with \nsome signs of increase in manufact\nured goods prices and service prices \nand ongoing strong monetary expansion Œ is of particular concern to the \nGoverning Council. We will do our ut\nmost and we stand ready to act in a \ntimely manner to make sure that it \ndoes not affect inflation expectations. \nThis objective automatically entails t\nhat we will not tole\nrate the emergence \nof second round effects.  \n \nBut let me deliver some more insights into the Governing Council™s \n\ndecision making process: Yesterday, \nwe cross-checked the information \nfrom our economic and monetary analysis.\n The sharp rise in inflation has \nfully confirmed our assessment that th\ne outlook for prices is subject to \nupside risks. By contrast, the economic fundamentals have remained \n\nsound and the medium-term outlook is \nstill favourable, with real GDP in \nthe euro area being expected to grow \nat around trend potential in 2008, \nalbeit subject to downside risks. \n\n \nMonetary policymakers have two eyes: one for the baseline scenario and \n\nthe other for the associated risks and uncer\ntainty. In that respect, ongoing \nfinancial market turbulence and a conti\nnuing reappraisal of risks increases \nthe uncertainty surrounding our inflationary assessment.  All in all, our analysis has\n shown that we face ups\nide risks to price stability \nand downside risks to economic growth and\n - in my view - that both risks \nhave augmented in comparison to the S\neptember staff projections. At the \nsame time, uncertainty is at the cu\nrrent juncture somewhat larger than \nusual in prognostic terms. As you know, these staff projections are part of \n\nour information gathering process. They are set up and made public four \n\ntimes a year, hence the next projection will be available in December. In a period of rapidly moving market\ns, our September assumptions are \nlikely to undergo substantial changes. So\n far, oil prices have continued to \nhike and reached new record highs. Moreover, the euro has continued to \n\nappreciate since September\n, both vis-à-vis the US-Dollar, but also against \na broad number of tr\nading partners. The recent financial market turmoil is \nlikely to decelerate the pace of econom\nic growth in several economies Œ \nalthough the global economy as a whole \nis still on a growth path. Thus, the", "Embargo: 9 November, 2007, 05:30 p.m. local time \n  Page 5 of 8 driving forces tend to shift from the \nUSA to Asia and Europe (which, by the \nway, will help to reduce global imbalances).  \n \nGiven these changes in the euro area™s economic environment, chances \n\nare that both upside risks to inflation \nand downside risks to output growth \nwill continue to remain elevated in t\nhe next few weeks. Given this outlook, \nwe have reiterated that we will act in\n a firm and timely manner in order to \ndeliver price stability over the medium term. \n\n \nAt this point, it is of particular re\nlevance that second-round effects are \navoided and that long-te\nrm inflation expectations remain anchored at \nlevels consistent with price stability. \n\n Appropriate measures of price stability But back to my original subject: The aspect of volatile energy and food \nprices has been taken up in this conf\nerence from another angle Œ one that \nis highly relevant to monetary poli\ncy: the question of the appropriate \nmeasure of inflation (see: Mark \nA. Wynne: How should central banks \ndefine price stability).  \n\n \nThe appropriate treatment of supply s\nhocks by central banks with price \nstability as their primary goal certainl\ny does not mean that monetary policy \nshould counteract each and every shor\nt-term price shock. Owing to the \nwell-known time lags of monetary poli\ncy, this would introduce short-term \nvolatility in interest rates and output that might be regarded as unwelcome.   \nThe monetary policy strategy of the Eu\nrosystem takes this aspect into \naccount in that it defines\n price stability as a medi\num-term objective. This, \nin my view, goes a long way towards \nreaping the postulated benefits of \ndefining price stability by core meas\nures rather than by headline figures, \nwhile avoiding some of the pitfalls of \ntargeting core inflation, such as \ncommunication and accountability issues or observable trend inflation in \nexcluded components, e.g. oil prices.  \n\n \nThus, I completely agree with Mark A. Wynne when he states that \n\nmeasures of headline inflation at the \nconsumer level are best for defining \nprice stability. In addition, Mark \nA. Wynne™s paper touches upon a highly \nrelevant issue in the context of asse\nt prices when discussing the treatment \nof owner-occupied housing. \n \nHere, I have repeatedly argued that t\nhe euro area HICP should include \nowner-occupied housing. But, just as \nan aside, I would prefer not to \ndiscuss this issue in the context of \nasset prices. Including owner-occupied \nhousing using the net acquisition \napproach is focused on housing as a \nconsumption good, not as an asset price.", "Embargo: 9 November, 2007, 05:30 p.m. local time \n  Page 6 of 8 2.2 Monetary policy and financial stability \nCentral banks as liquidity providers\n As Forrest Capie already outlined in \nhis survey paper, financial stability \nhas been a key defining historical f\neature of central banking. Central \nbanks acted and continue to act as lender\n of last resort, that is, as the \ninstitution which comes to the aid of\n markets in times of a liquidity \nshortage. This is still relevant now\nadays, as the recent financial market \nturbulence has shown.  \n\n \nThe Eurosystem has been called on as a ﬁ\nliquidity provider of last resortﬂ. \nAnd our interventions have had a stabilising effect on euro money \n\nmarkets. Our focus in this respect \nis not on helping financial markets \nper se or even on bailing-out dist\nressed institutions, but on alleviating tensions \nin financial markets where malf\nunctioning would pose a serious \nmacroeconomic risk to achieving our\n objective of price stability.  Therefore, contrary to \ncomments that are sometimes made to the effect \nthat the central bank can do more, nam\nely reduce interest rates below the \nlevel normally deemed appropriate, ther\ne are good economic reasons why \nwe make a strict separation between the \ntwo aspects of liquidity provision, \non the one hand, and signa\nls about our general policy stance, on the \nother. In short, a central bank™s interest\n rate policy is th\ne wrong instrument for combating tensions in money markets. \n While our liquidity providing operations\n helped to smooth difficult market \nconditions, the financial turbulence of\n the past few months will certainly \noffer the opportunity for some further\n debate on the appropriate lessons to \nbe learnt for monetary policy in general.  Monetary policy and asset prices \nOne aspect that has been debated thr\noughout the past couple of years \nand also at this conference Œ a debate wh\nich, at a first guess, will intensify \nŒ is the question of the proper role \nof asset prices in the conduct of \nmonetary policy. \n \nBoom-bust cycles in asset prices wit\nh ensuing liquidity crises are of \nspecial concern for monetary policymakers for (at least) two reasons. First, \nto the extent that changes in asse\nt prices affect consumption and \ninvestment, there might be spill-over effects on inflation. Second, the \ntransmission of monetary policy acti\nons to the economy works largely \nthrough the financial system. Undoubtedly,\n asset price increases unrelated \nto economic fundamentals have the potent\nial to reduce t\nhe overall welfare of an economy and should be avoided wherever possible.  \n \nHowever, there remains the question of \nhow far this is feasible and how it \nshould be achieved. Financial market im\nbalances are often the result of", "Embargo: 9 November, 2007, 05:30 p.m. local time \n  Page 7 of 8 underlying structural imbal\nances which should be a\nppropriately addressed \nthrough policies other than monetary po\nlicy. In particular, regulatory \nmeasures represent an obvious candidate for suitable \nex ante action.   \nNonetheless, it has been \nargued that central banks might prevent asset \nprice bubbles in the first place by \nresponding to asset prices over and \nabove their expected effect on inflation. Yet, such an approach requires \nthat the central bank is able to identif\ny an asset price bubble in real time, \nwhich means it has to resolve the ﬁdiagnosis problemﬂ and must be able to \n\naffect the path of asset prices, which \nmeans it has to overcome the ﬁpolicy \nproblemﬂ. In general, central banks will no\nt be able to recognise bubbles in \nreal time with a sufficient degree of confidence. This applies even more \n\nforcefully to the early stages of a \nbubble, when monetary policy should be \nmost effective. \n \nNevertheless, there is the proposal \nthat central banks should respond very \ncautiously to asset prices because \nthere is some probab\nility that a bubble \nmight be at the root of asset prices \nchanges. According to this argument, a \ncentral bank that leans against changes \nin asset prices would buy some \ninsurance in case a bubble is on the way. \n \nHowever, this argument remains debatable. First, raising interest rates to \n\nprevent bubbles does not co\nme without cost. Second, it is far from obvious \nwhether monetary policy is at all effe\nctive in dealing wit\nh bubbles. Even a \ncomparatively sharp rise in interest rates may be no more than a minor \n\nnuisance to investors; on the other \nhand, such an upsurge in the policy \nrate may already be a serious bur\nden in other parts \nof the economy. \nMoreover, it might entail the risk of\n not meeting our traditional primary \nobjectives. Making an insurance analog\ny, the premium may simply be too \ncostly relative to its benefit. In ot\nher words, the adoption of other policy \nmeasures may be more appropriate in times of potential bubbles.  \n \nIn summary, in a world in which asset price bubbles are very difficult to \n\nidentify and in which it may be very co\nstly in terms of \ninflation and output to lean against asset prices, the central bank should remain focused on \n\nprice stability.  \n \nOf course, this does not mean that cent\nral banks are ignorant of what is \ngoing on in financial and real estate ma\nrkets. At the Bundesbank, as at \nother central banks, we observe a lar\nge number of indicators which give \nus an idea of financial imbalances \nand also help us to predict \nmacroeconomic conditions. Just to remind you, in the Eurosystem we \n\nhave a strategy that deliberately ta\nkes account of credit and monetary \nfactors.  Financial stability, central ba\nnks and banking supervision Let me finally elaborate on some of \nthe policy implications or lessons \nlearnt from the recent financial turmo\nil. During the past few months, it has", "Embargo: 9 November, 2007, 05:30 p.m. local time \n  Page 8 of 8 proved useful that centra\nl banks play an active part in banking supervision. \nAccess to supervisory information has \nenabled us to respond quickly and \nappropriately to the liquidity demands \nof the banking system. As I pointed \nout earlier, the lessons learnt for c\nentral banks are more on the regulatory \nside. It is not an issue of reassessing our general monetary strategy. Some of the most pressing regulatory \nissues include the role of credit \nrating agencies, the treatment of o\nff-balance-sheet conduits, and valuation \nissues of highly complex structured products. \n \nThis conference has taken up another \nhot topic in banking supervision and \nfinancial stability, that is appropriate r\negulation in a world of cross-border \nbanking institutions (see: Mattias Perss\non: Achieving financial stability in a \nworld of cross-border institutions).\n He has given us a comprehensive \noverview of the challenges and open issu\nes in the supervision and crisis \nmanagement of cross-border banking gr\noups in Europe. I would agree \nwith the bottom line of Mattias Per\nsson™s paper: supervisory structures \nshould follow market structures and not vice versa.  \nAcknowledging that cross-border bank\ning structures in Europe will \nincrease in the future, I also see possi\nble future challenges in supervision \narrangements. But, at the current \njuncture, I would argue that the \nstructures currently in place are \nappropriate to dealing with regulatory \nissues. And, as these stru\nctures are relatively new\n, they should be allowed \nto demonstrate their functi\nonality and to evolve over \ntime rather than being \nsubject to a quantum leap to a unifi\ned European supervisory agency. This \nis even more important as many key \nissues are not yet resolved yet, for \nexample, the harmonisation of depos\nit insurance schemes or bankruptcy \nlaws. \n 3 Conclusions \nAll this makes clear, that important \nchallenges for monetary policy remain \nand they certainly will in\nfluence the future design of central banks. \nArguably, the current design of cent\nral banks has been influenced by \nacademic research more than that of \nany other public in\nstitution. Thus, \nconferences like this, in which policy makers and academics come \n\ntogether to exchange views,\n are of utmost importance. Thus, let me thank \nonce again all participants involved and the organisers. \n \n *   *   *"], "SECTION": "reden", "RECORD_ID": 799}
