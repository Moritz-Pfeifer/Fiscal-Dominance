No one steps into the same river twice. Allthingsare subject to changeandin constant flow. But it makes a very big difference which river you step into the gently flowing Main-river, for example, or the headwaters of the Rhine-river. As far as the financial markets are concerned, there is much to indicate that we are caught up in a raging mountain river which is di~~ging a new bed after heavy thundery ram. During the past few years, individuals, enterprises, markets, institutions and governments have been up against a raging current of change in the conditions under which they operate. Remaining passive in the face of such a development is fatal. lt is imperative to take an active role in shaping those conditions or, at least, to Iook ahead and adapt to the given circumstances. ln this situation, it is the primary task of the legislature toset the underlying statutory and regulatory conditions which enable legal certainty, equal opportunity and competition to prevail on the markets- not just nationally, but internationally too. Examples of this to be cited for Germany are the implementation of EC directives on capital market liberalisation, the construction of an efficient securities trading supervision, the planned extensive reform of legislation governing stock exchange transactions and - probably of greatest significance at the moment- the recent tax reform.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.09.2000 lt is up to market organisers and market players to create efficient market structures and offer products that hold out the promise of sustained profits within the given statutory framewerk in line with the pursuit of their individual business. lnstances of this are the emergence of new stock markets and stock market segments, and the creation of a large number of derivative instruments. Following the establishment of the European Centrat Bank (ECB), the Bundesbank is now an integral part of the European System of Centrat Banks (ESCB). The Bundesbank participates in the performance of the ESCB's tasks with the primary objective of maintaining price stability, and arranges for the execution of domestic and international payments. Price stability and a functionally viable financial market structure are the preconditions which permanently have to be ensured so that there can be efficiency in financial transactions. ln turn, efficient financial markets are the indispensable medium for a predictable and rapid transmission of monetary policy measures. Seen in that light, monetary policy and efficient financial markets are in a symbiotic relationship. Although the Bundesbank cannot, on regulatory grounds, take on the role of moderater - or even promoter - for the financial centre that some market players would like, it is, in fact, always ready to give active support as an advisor and initiator. The modernisation of German debt management or the customer friendly ECB minimum reserve arrangements are illustrations ofDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.09.2000 that. The fact that monetary policy has been transferred to the European Central Bank allows the Bundesbank to attend more than before to the continued strengthening of the competitiveness of the financial markets in Germany. 2. A radical transformation is taking place in the financial sector, driven by the \"me{Ja trends\" of globalisation, deregulation, innovation and the use of new technologies. ln this connection, the trend has been stren~]thened by the introduction of the single currency in Europe. Securitisation was already one of the dominant trends in the early and mid-nineties. The adoption of the euro has now broughl about a further surge in securitisation and given an additional boost to disintermediation. For the German credit institutions, the euro means that they no Ionger have the competitive advantage of the 0-Mark, whereas for others it means that they no Iongerface the \"D-Mark home currency\" barrier to entering the market. Garnpetition is becoming more and more intense within Europe and globally. lncreasingly, credit institutionsnot only have to withstand growing competition from other banks but are also competing to a greater extent with insurance enterprises, investment and pension funds as weil as on-line brokers - in some cases even from within their own groups. The response to such developments can basically be either consolidation or cpecialisation. Consolidation- even if only at the national Ievei- is not an easy undertaking. The past failed attempts of the big German banks to merge in a range ofDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.09.2000 combinations illustrate how difficult it is to bring tagether different cerparate cultures and strategies. lt may be that the favourable tax treatment of capital gains from the sale of domestic participating interests from 2002 will provide new impetus for mergers. Another possibility is cross-border consolidation in Europe with the involvement of German institutions. However, irrespective of the Common Market and EMU national interests have often stood in the way of cross-border activities. lt is also often argued in this context that, because of the comparatively streng competition as a result of the density of banks' branches, the majority of German creldit institutions are generally - but especially in retail banking-not profitable enough. To counter such criticism and create the conditions for cross-border consolidation, further streamlining of the branch network and the increased use of new technologies therefore seem inevitable. 3. The introduction of the euro created the essential precondition for the development of a large supranational euro capital market. The fragmentation into national capital markets particularly band markets- which was essentially due to the existence of different currencies and the resulting interest-rate differentials, can admittedly still be feit. But, under the influence of competition, the previously national markets are increasingly merging and gradually losing their special features. The immediate conversion of government issues into euro and the large degree of harmonisation in market conventions have played a major part in the rnarket becoming more homogeneous.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.09.2000 For a variety of reasons, the emergence of a completely uniform European band market will scarcely be possible. Despite a greater degree of coordination, the fiscal, economic and social policies of the participating countries will, for the present, remain anational responsibility. That is likewise true of government debt management with its significant repercussions for the capital markets. Differences in financial standing, liquidity and issuing procedures, and the varying efficiency with which the cash, futures and repo markets interact in the individual countrieswill ensure yield differentials in the case of issuers and issues in the medium term as weil. ln that respect, the Federal Government is in a favourable position. Even after losin~J the competitive advantage of the D-Mark, it has remained the benchmark issuer and is able to borrow at the comparativHiy lowest cost. Forthat reason, the Federal Government- quite apart from the fundamental legal reservations against a communitisation of debt management should hardly be intereste~d in communitised borrowing under the umbrella of a European debt agency. As experience of the German Länderjumbos shows, its financing costs might tend to rise. What should also not be overlooked is the fact that competition among the individual countries for the lowest possible financing costs has a healthy influence on budgetary policy and the efficiency of issuing policy.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.09.2000 lf the debt agency that is planned by the Federal Minister of Finance does come about- despite many reservations, not least on part of the Bundesban~\\ -, I hope it will be able to maintain or even build on the present streng position of the Federal Government as an issuer. The Bundesbank is ready to werk tagether with the debt agency, tobring its expertise to bear and, in particular, to provide all the oparational banking services for it. This would also signal to the markets that setting up the debt agency does not imply any abrupt paradigm change in debt management. That applies especially to any apparently politically motivated strenger short-tHrm orientation in borrowing. 4. Non-government issuers, too, have successfully adapted to the new underlying conditions. Mortgage banks regularly put \"jumbo mortgage bonds\" on the market, and place them successfully with foreign investors as weil. The issuers are thereby making use of the fact that institutional investors in Europe are gearing their portfolios more and more to euro-area wide investment. \"Exporting\" mortgage bonds means that the idea of Iang-term fixed-ratE~ real estate financing is also being exported. I believe this tobe a good thing since it promotes the stability of the financial system in Europe. Despite several signs of becoming more popular, domestically issued cerparate bonds continue to Iead a somewhat neglected existence in Germany. Above all, because one-half of paid interest on permanent debts is included in trade earnings, German enterprises are prompted to issue bonds through foreignDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.09.2000 financing vehicles. Abolishing that regulation would be desirable but would probably be realistic only in connection with the abolition or reorganisation of trade tax as such. Overall, the \"corporate bonds\" sector is growing sharply in Germany- as it is throughout the euro area. Lower government deficits - which are made possible by higher tax revenues, the auctioning of mobile telecommunications licences, privatisations as weil as a consistent course of limiting expenditure, are creating scope for cerparate financing through the band market. lnstitutional investors appreciate the enhanced opportunities of portfolio diversification, which bring with them not only higher yields but also greater risks. 5. There has been a clear improvement in the \"share culture\" in Germany over the past few years. Large, broadly spread issues, such as those of Telekom or of t-online, have played a part in that in the same way as the extremely successful development of the \"Neuer Markt\" as a new stock market segment for young high-growth enterprises. The frequent claim that Germaninvestors are risk-shy and prefer fixed-yield paper has been emphatically refuted over the past few years. The - in some cases -meteoric price increases on the \"Neuer Markt\" have, if anything, given rise to the fear of widespread euphoria leading to a Iack of discernment. The more reflective mood that has now set in is only to be welcomed in the interests of a favourable market development in the Ionger term.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.09.2000 The number and market capitalisation of listed German public limited companies have made great advances in the past few years: • At the end of 1995, 527 enterprises achieved a market value equivalent to € 575 billion.l • At the end of 1999, the figure was already 933 enterprises with a market value of € 1 ,426 bimon. • Measured in terms of GDP, market capitalisation is now at 68 o/o compared with 24 °/o at th(:~ end of 1995. This means that Germany is still in a lower mid-table position among the industrial countries. There exists potential for further growth. 6. The European stock market Iandscape is still distinctly fragmented with a large number of market models, trading and settlement systems. Mergers and close cooperation are inevitable if one wishes to approach the ideal of the perfect market by means of pooling liquidity and lowering transaction costs. The Deutsche Börse AG recognised that fact at an early stage and took the Iead in that development. ln the \"contest of the systems\" between \"open outcry\" and electronic trading in the futures market, it was consistent in opting for the electronic alternative and thus decided the competition for the Bund Future - the capital market contract which currently has the highest turnever-in its own favour. Generally, it seems that the triumphant progress of electronic trading systems- whether it be stock exchange or OTC trading-Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.09.2000 is irresistible. Not being bound to a single location, transparency and low transaction co~ts are major advantages. Not all Deutsche Börse AG's plans and projects have been realised. Who ventures much will also lose sometimes. But who ventures nothing will nevHr gain. As someone said in a recent discussion with German banks: \"There are no failed experiments. There are only experiments with unexpected outcomes.\" lt is not just for monetary policy reasons that the Bundesbank is interested in efficient financial markets and therefore also in efficient trading and settlement systems. As the fiscal agent for the Federal Government, the Bundesbank is also a major market player in on-the-floor band trading in the stock market and in Xetra bonds. The Federal Government and the Bundesbank have been following Deutsche Börse AG's plans for Eurex bonds as a successor system for Xetra bonds from the outset and, a few weeks ago, decided on active participation. The Federal Government and the Bundesbank have declared their expectation that the systemwill be open to a wide range of participants. ln this connection, I hope that Deutsche Börse AG soon succeeds in the intemded linking of the cash, futures and repo markets and that it can successfully hold its own in competition with other electronic band trading systems. 7. Germany sometimes has difficulties with reforms. ln a federally structured state with numerous strong interest groups, that comes as no surpriste. lt is therefore all the more gratifying toDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.09.2000 state that - despite alt the c:riticism of specific points - a tax reform has been initiated which deserves the name. The tax reform will bring about a crucial improvement in the conditions for economic activity in Germany. 1t will mean a considerable easing of the burden an enterprise~s and households and create planning certainty for the medium term. The fact that capital gains from sales of domestic participating interests are to be exempt from tax in the case of incorporated enterprises will make the - in some cases - overdue restructuring of German groups much easier. With the lowelring of cerparate tax rates, Germany will in future occupy a competitive mid-table position in international terms. What is a problem, howeve~r, isthat the reformwill create further competitive distortions owing to retained profits being given preferential treatment over the distribution of dividends by incorporated enterprises, and other sources of taxable inca·me. This will weaken the steering function of the capital markets. What will prove to be a particular drawback for the financial centre Frankfurt is the planned tax prohibition on offsetting Iosses arising from share derivatives against profits from the underlying shares. Here, a better solution should be found. Another justifiable point of criticism is the continued failure even to make a start on simplifying the highly complex German tax system. Tax consultancy is still going tobe a growth industry in Germany.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.09.2000 Despite all the satisfaction about tax relief measures, we should not overlook the fact that: the tax burden will still be quite high in Germany, which means that Germany has to maintain a · consistent course of fiscal consolidation. Excluding the receipts from the mobile telecommunications licences, the fiscal balance in 2000 will show only a slight improvement despite much higher tax revenues. ln the corning year, the structural deficit will increase significantly. ln other words: further reductions in expenditure are required in order to create scope for lower taxes. 8. Maintaining and enhancing Germany's overall competitiveness - and certainly not just the competitiveness of its financial markets- is an ongoing task. International investors are looking to how Gerrnany, as Europe's largest economy, copes with changed underlying conditions. Much has already occurred or been set in motion in Germany, such as the privatisation of former public enterprises tagether with market liberalisation and deregulation in such important areas as telecommunications and the post servies, or price liberalisation in electricity. What still has to be done is the reorganisation of our social systems in line with foreseeable demographic developments. The basic features of the statutory pension scheme reform presented by the Federal Government would contribute to distributing the demographically induced burdens more equally between the present and future generations of pensioners, but consideration should continue to be given to raising the actualDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.09.2000 retirement age. The envisaged capital-backed supplementary pension would also place the funding of old-age provision on a broader foundation. What is also needed is to make our labour markets more flexible with the aim of reducing unemployment, which is still very high. That would also be an essential condition for bringing down non wage labour costs - which are extremely high by international standards-in a systemically a.ppropriate manner. Regrettably, the reforms that have already been implemented or are planned in Germany as weil as in other European countries have received scant attention up to now outside of Europe. The markets obviously lean towards an asymmetrical view of things, with matehing consequences for the external value of the euro. 9. ln conclusion, I would like to say a few words on our own behalf. The establishment of the ECB has created a new Ievei of decision-making in the monetary policy of the countries in the euro area. The Bundesbank is now part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). This means that the Central Bank Council no Ionger has the power to decide monetary policy. What is necessary under the new conditions is to have a uniform management body located in Frankfurt. This would mean that the provision of Bundesbank services to the regions is not jeopardised.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.09.2000 The independence of the ECB and of the national central banks within the ESCB is a key feature of European monetary policy. The \"de-nationalisation\" which this achieved was desired by all of member states and explicitly recognised by the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, which was unanimously approved by the secend chamber oftheGerman parliament representing the Länder or regions, the Bundesrat. Monetary policy can only be \"de-nationalised\", however, if national aspects no Iongerplaya role in the assessment of monet:ary policy. That applies all the more to specific regional aspects. The Bundesbank is ready to adjust. During the past few weeks and months, the President of the Bundesbank has repeatedly pushed for the necessary measures of reform. As a member of the ECB Governing Council, he is aware of what kind of reforms are needed. That is not so in the~ case of proposals that have recently been put torward elsewhere, which, by contrast, appear to be short of the basic information about how the ESCB operates. Tackling the reform of the Bundesbank now with all speed and setting a clear course~ is something that undoubtedly requires political courage. The Bundesbank's ability to reform - something which the Bundesbank itself desires - is, however, indicative of the \"reform-ability\" of Germany as a whole. This, in turn, lies in the hands of the politicians. We are waiting for good and torward looking political decisions. * 'Ir *"}
