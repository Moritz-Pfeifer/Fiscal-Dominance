It is a pleasure \nfor me \nto speak to you \ntoday\n. The \nturn\n of \nthe\n year lends itself to \nlooking back and reflecting on the past year \nas well as \nto \nlook\ning\n ahead \nto the new year\n. In \nthis spirit I will start \nmy speech \nwith an overview of the economy in 2010 \nand the \noutlook \nfor\n 2011 before \naddressing the issue\ns of financial \nmarket regulation\n and\n the current debt crisis\n. I consciously refrain from calling the current de\nbt crisis ﬁEuropeanﬂ since the strong \naccumulation of public debt is far from being a purely European problem \nŒ however, being in \nBrussels, I will, of course, conclude with some remarks on the necessary measures in the \n\neuro area.\n 2 The economy \nin \n2010 and 20\n11 Economically\n the year 2010 \nbrought\n a turn \nfor \nthe better.\n The world economy\n picked up \nconsiderably\n and the German economy \nin particular \nmade an \nunexpectedly strong\n recovery", "Embargo: \n27 January\n 201\n1, 18:\n15 CET   Page 3 of \n8  Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n  Wilhelm\n-Epstein\n-Str\nasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany\n www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse\n-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel.: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077\n Reproduction is permitted only if source is stated.\n from \nthe stresses and strains of \nthe financial crisis\n. Growth expectations from \nthe beginning \nof 2010 were \nclearly\n outperformed during the course of the year\n. With GDP growth \nat \n3.6%\n, Germany was able to make up a good portion of \nthe\n 4.7% \nslump\n of 2009\n. In the process\n, German\ny profited \nsignificantly \nfrom the rapid recovery of \nthe \nglob\nal economy and \nglobal \ntrade\n. However, more recently\n, domestic \ndemand\n Œ which had already been an important \nstabilising factor at the height of the crisis\n Œ has gained momentum as well\n. The resilience of \nthe German economy d\nuring the crisis in the face of a\nn extraordinarily \nsevere \nnegative \nshock is\n, not least\n, the reward\n of major \nreforms\n that were undertaken in the first half of the \nlast decade\n. Particular\nly the increased flexibility on the \nlabour market\n helped \nGermany \nto \ncome through \nthe crisis in \nan accept\nable shape\n, and \nnot only stabilise\nd private consumption\n but also allowed \nenterprises \na smooth handling of the surprisingly \nvigorous\n increase\n in \ndemand in the upturn.\n  However, not all countries\n of the \neuro area\n have \nweathered the crisis so successfully\n. Indeed\n, the \nspectrum of economic performance has been\n rather \nmixed\n. The euro area has \nseen heterogeneity in growth rates before, but now\n parts are reversed, as\n Germany \ncurrently\n occupies the role of \ngrowth motor\n in the euro area\n. These differences\n within the\n union\n should not be dismissed \nas purely\n cyclical\n: they are \na consequence of \nthe \nstructural \nadaptation cris\nis affecting \nseveral\n countries \nof the periphery.\n When one considers \nthe \ndifficulties these countries \nare currently facing \nas well as\n the possible\n con\nsequence\ns for the \neuro area as a whole\n, it becomes evident that the outlook for 2011 and \nbeyond\n depends on \ndrawing the correct conclusions \nfrom the crisis \nand, from there\n, taking the right decisions\n. The expectation \nat the moment \nis that the \nglobal \nrecover\ny will\n continue\n in 2011\n, albeit \nat \na slower pace than in the past year. \nUnder this assumption\n, the \nBundesbank in \nits \nDecember \nMonthly \nReport forecast GDP in Germany to grow at a rate\n of 2% \nin \n2011 and 1.5% the year \nafter. \nThis means that\n the pre\n-crisis lev\nel of production \nwould\n be reached at the end of \n2011\n, and production \nwould \nbe back to full capacity at \nabout \nthe same time.\n Indic\nators that have", "Embargo: \n27 January\n 201\n1, 18:\n15 CET   Page 4 of \n8  Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n  Wilhelm\n-Epstein\n-Str\nasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany\n www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse\n-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel.: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077\n Reproduction is permitted only if source is stated.\n been released since then support the picture of an ongoing recovery and have even tended \nto surprise to the ups\nide.\n Development\ns on the \ncapital markets\n during the past year w\nere\n affected by the loss of \nconfidence that emerged during the course of the debt crisis\n.

Even the\nir optimism \nonly \ngained the upper hand \nduring the course of the \nsecond \nhalf of the year\n Œ at the same time as \nthe \neconomic outlook brightened\n. 3 Financial market regulation\n The crisis has clearly demonstrated the \nneed for\n stric\nter financial market regulation, \nespecially as \nthe financial\n sector was at \nthe \nheart\n of the crisis\n. Safeguarding f\ninancial \nstability has therefore rightly \nbeen a top priority on the policy agenda. \nThe G20 agenda and \nthe summit in Seoul in November testify \nto the global dimension \nof \nthe task of \nfinancial \nmarket regulation.\n A number of crucial reform measures \ndesigned \nto secure financial \nstability have already been approved or at least \ngot underway \nin the past year.\n The increase \nin \ncapital requirements in qua\nntity and quality, commonly termed ﬁBasel IIIﬂ\n, is \nthe most \nprominent achievement\n.

These measures \nare intended to enable financial institutions \nto better cope with possible losses themselves and thus lower the probability of an institution\n becoming\n insolven\nt Œ which can be \nviewed\n as a first line of defence\n. Measures that target systemic risk comprise a second line of defence that will come into \nplay if the first line is broken and an institution become\ns insolvent. \nIn this regard, the\n Financ\nial Stability Board (FSB)\n currently\n develops strong regulatory and supervisory policies \nin the interest\ns of financial stability. \nOn a national level, Germany has recently passed a law \non the restructuring of insolvent financial institutions. This is certai\nnly a \nwelcome \nstep, \nalthough, as in other areas of regulation, national restructuring mechanisms will only be fully \neffective if they are mutually compatible, ie if the approach \nfor their implementation is \ninternationally coordinated.

Other measures to address systemi\nc risk are currently being developed and will accompany \nus throughout 2011 as they require \neither \nfurther discussion or at least ratification. \nAs \nsystemic risk \nis a complex area\n, the issue\n requires\n a multi\n-faceted approach.\n This\n include\ns the question of ho\nw exactly to deal with institutions that are ﬁtoo big to failﬂ or the \nimprovement of corporate governance, eg via the implementation of the FSB™s international \ncompensation standards.\n Further topics discussed \nwith regard to\n increasing the \ntransparency of f\ninancial market operations are the mandatory registration of institutions that \ncurrently \noperate\n in the shadow banking system as well as the standardisation of contracts \nand handling of derivatives.

During the course \nof the financial and economic crisis\n, many\n countries\n had accumulated a large amount of \ndebt via guarantees or costly fiscal policy measures that had been implemented to prevent \n\nvital markets from co\nllaps\ning\n during the financial and economic turmoil, in particular after the \nLehman insolvency. However, this was the case in most member states, and so the \nreasons\n why only some of them \nsuffered \na serious\n loss of\n market participants'\n confidence in their \ncapacity to bear the debt burden\n lie further in the past: In these countries, fiscal and \neconomic policy \nomissions \nin the years before the crisis led to an accumulation of explicit or \nimplicit liabilities \nin the state™s budget and a significant loss of compe\ntitiveness. \nConsequently, the driving forces behind the increase in perceived sovereign risk were not \nspeculative forces on \nthe \nfinancial markets but \npoor\n fundamentals. \n When \nthe loss of confidence culminated for the first time in May, comprehensive suppor\nt measures for Greece \nŒ where the situation was particularly dire \nŒ were taken to avoid risks \nfor the stability of the euro area as a whole. Financial support was tied to a tough, closely \n\nmonitored adjustment programme aim\ned at restoring the sustainability\n of public finances in \nGreece. In addition, a rescue scheme financed by the IMF, the European Union and \nits \n\nmember states was set up to deal with future intensifications of the crisis. Again, financial \n\nsupport is granted only if a member state undergoes a \ntough adjustment programme that \nsecures public solvency. This conditionality is crucial: Financial support can buy some time, \nbut confidence in the sustainability of public finances will only return if substantial structural \n\nimprovements in the respective \ncountries \nŒ be it in Greece or in Ireland\n, which called for", "Embargo: \n27 January\n 201\n1, 18:\n15 CET   Page 7 of \n8  Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n  Wilhelm\n-Epstein\n-Str\nasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany\n www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse\n-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel.: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077\n Reproduction is permitted only if source is stated.\n support \nfrom\n the EFSF, EFSM and IMF in November after the fiscal burdens related to \nsupporting its oversized financial sector became overwhelming.\n For the financial system™s future stability and e\nffectiveness\n, it is indispensable to \nensure that\n confidence in the stability of public finances\n remains intact\n. To achieve this,\n not only \na credible consolidation of public finances \nis needed but also improvements in economic \ngovernance in EMU that ensure \nprudent fiscal policies in the medium to long run. Against \nthis background\n, the current discussion about\n Œ and\n even \ncalls for\n Œ euro bonds \nmust\n be \nviewed\n critically. Euro bonds would \nrender all euro\n-area countries \njoint\nly and several\nly liab\nle, \nthereby erod\ning\n each state\n™s own fiscal responsibility. The incentive \nfor consolidating\n public \nfinances would be \nreduc\ned, \nalong\n with the credibility \nof \nand confidence in the state™s ability \nto service its debt \nŒ which is \ncertainly the opposite of what is needed.\n 5 Concl\nusion\n Ladies and gentlemen, although \nthe financial sector has been at \nthe heart of the crisis, the \nthird phase of the current crisis\n, which \nemerged\n in 2010\n, clearly demonstrated the \nimportance of sound economic and financial policy, as confidence in a stat\ne™s solvency also \n plays a substantial role in securing financial stability\n. For the time being\n, the euro area \nhas\n the necessary measures to deal with the debt crisis\n at its disposal\n. I hope\n that this speech \nhas highlighted\n the \nclear\n necessity of \n  a swift \nand ambitious budgetary consolidation in order to restore confidence in \npublic \nfinances\n,  strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact in order to prevent states from \nmanoeuvring into destabili\nsing situations that can cause a crisis,", "Embargo: \n27 January\n 201\n1, 18:\n15 CET   Page 8 of \n8  Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n  Wilhelm\n-Epstein\n-Str\nasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany\n www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse\n-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel.: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077\n Reproduction is permitted only if source is stated.\n  a surveillance and early\n warning mechanism in order to have the ability to take \ncounter measures \nat an early stage\n if necessary,\n  a crisis resolution mechanism that permits the euro area to deal with a country in \ncrisis without undermining the no\n-bail\n-out principle and hence the i\nncentives for \nresponsible, stability\n-oriented fiscal policies, and the necessity of\n  implement\ning\n a national ﬁdebt brakeﬂ to keep budgets in balance once they are \nconsolidated. \n The crisis has painfully demonstrated several weaknesses \nin the regulatory syst\nem and \nimperfections in our economic and fiscal policies. If we manage to improve the regulatory \nframework for the financial system and maintain well\n-disciplined government budgets, we \nwill be in a good position to ensure financial stability in the future.\n  This is the important task \nwe must address in 2011\n.  Ladies and gentlemen, Europe is more than just economy and currency. Based on its \n\ntradition, culture and diversity, Europe is currently on its way to a new unity. We are all \ncalled on to help achieve t\nhis goal. There are many problems lying ahead of us. H\nowever, \nwith courage, openness\n and honesty we can overcome these problems.\n I wish you personally health and happiness for 2011 and I wish Europe, in particular, \n\ncontinuing success. It is worth working f\nor.\n Thank you very much for your attention\n. *    *    *"], "SECTION": "reden", "RECORD_ID": 635}
