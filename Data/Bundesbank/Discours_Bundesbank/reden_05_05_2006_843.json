I would like to\n welcome the presenters, discussants and other guests who have come to Eltville to take part in the conference.   \nForecasting is nowadays a central element in the decision-making process of central banks. This conference aims to present and discuss new \ninsights gained from academic research which might help to improve the \ncurrent practice of forecasting, with the aim of using these insights to develop further the forecasting tools employed by the Bundesbank and the \nEurosystem.  \n \nTo start with, it might be helpful to take stock. Therefore, in my introductory remarks, I shall be discussing vari\nous aspects of the forecasting \nprocedures employed at central b\nanks with a special focus on the Eurosystem and the Bundesbank.  \n\n \nThere is a straightforward reason why central banks have a strong interest in forecasting: because of lags in the effects of monetary policy on macroeconomic activity monetary policy cannot affect current inflation and", "Embargo: 5 May, 2006, 09:00 a.m. local time \n  Page 3 of 20 \noutput.1 Owing to these lags, it is widely recognised that monetary policy should be forward-looking and have a medium-term perspective. As a consequence, monetary policy decisions are, to some extent, dependent \non forecasts.  \n \nFuture developments in inflation and output are of key interest in central banks™ forecast exercises. The relevance of price developments stems from the fact that the primary objective of many central banks is to establish and maintain price stability. Their interest in forecasting output, or, more generally, some measure of broad macroeconomic activity, results from their influences on futu\nre prices. Moreover, many central banks take real developments into consideration for another reason: the \n\nobjectives of these central banks explicitly include real variables such as \nunemployment and output.  \n\n \nBut even for central banks, such as the Eurosystem, which have a more \n\nhierarchical ordering of objectives, and pursue price stability as the primary objective, output developments play an important role: Focusing exclusively on price stability, regardle\nss of the type of shock hitting the economy, would otherwise have the undesirable consequence of \nincreasing output volatility to inefficient\nly high levels. In the end, this may \ncomplicate the preservation of price stability.   \nAs part of their communication strategy, many central banks have decided to publish their forecasts in order to increase transparency. In a forward-looking environment, fostering tran\nsparency by means of published forecasts is more than an end in itself. It also serves to guide expectations \nof future monetary policy actions, thus making the central bank more effective in fulfilling its duties. For this reason, the quality of the forecasts                                            \n 1 A rough benchmark for the euro area is that\n monetary policy affects output in about a \nyear and inflation in about two years. \nSee Angeloni, Kashyap and Mojon (2003).", "Embargo: 5 May, 2006, 09:00 a.m. local time \n  Page 4 of 20 \nis crucial not only under reputation aspects but also for reasons of policy effectiveness.   \nAs a result, central banks have a natural interest in applying the best forecasting methods available. This necessitates to continuously \nincorporate the latest academic developments in forecasting into the models used by economic and research departments at central banks. In my following remarks, I shall discu\nss some of the recent developments. \n \n 2 Recent developments in forecasting \nOne way of distinguishing the main \ndevelopments in forecasting methods is to focus on the amount of information used for specifying forecast models:2   Forecasting in data-rich \nenvironments with as much information as is available:  \n Factor forecasting with large datasets,  \n Forecast pooling or combination, and  \n Disaggregation versus\n aggregation of data,   Forecasting with reduced information:  \n  Theory-based forecasting: for example DSGE models, \n Model selection: general\n-to-specific modelling \nstrategies                                             \n 2 See the overview article Clements and Hend\nry (2005), Guest Edit\nors™ Introduction: \nInformation in Economic Forecasting, Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics 67, \n\nissue s1, p. 714.", "Embargo: 5 May, 2006, 09:00 a.m. local time \n  Page 5 of 20 \nTo highlight the diversity of models within both the limited information and full-information approaches, I have included some examples of methods in the above listing which may be of potential use for central bank \nforecasting.  \n \n 2.1 Forecasting tools in central\n banks: some stocktaking What kind of forecasting approaches have been adopted by central \nbanks? As outlined in Sims (2002) and in Pagan & Robertson (2002), \nmost of the central banks employ traditional macroeconometric models, sometimes replaced by medium-scale DSGE models, as core or \nworkhorse models for forecasting and policy analysis. These models have \na well-specified theoretical framewor\nk in statistical and economic terms \nthat helps providing some economic interpretation of the forecast.\n3 Although most of the central bank work typically devotes around a single \ncore model, alternative macroeconometric or DSGE models of differing size or with different regional coverage are also employed.   \nAdditionally, a number of \neconometric time series models with little explicit \neconomic content are used for short-term forecasting, as they can be used to employ higher-frequency data and different datasets than the traditional \nmacroeconometric or DSGE models.  \n \nFinally, ‚judgement™ in terms of outside-model information is additionally used. \n \nHow are these forecasts used in practice? Iin general, forecasts from \ndifferent types of models are simultaneously taken into account in \nmonetary policy practice. As an example, the Bank of England has recently developed a suite of short-term forecasting models for GDP \n                                           \n 3 See Issing (2004), p. 730.", "Embargo: 5 May, 2006, 09:00 a.m. local time \n  Page 6 of 20 \ncontaining, among others, large-scale factor models and non-linear models.4 Forecasting results for combined forecasts with these models are reported in addition to the forecasts obtained by the Bank of England Quarterly Model (BEQM). In a recent study by the Bank of Sweden, both a non-theoretical BVAR and a DSGE m\nodel are used for forecasting and policy analysis.5 These examples show that not in all cases a single-\nmodel approach is followed, but rat\nher a ‚suite-of-models™ approach. \n \n 2.2 Arguments in favour of \nthe suite-of-models approach What are the reasons for centra\nl banks following these multi-model approaches? Why is it important to apply a variety of models in central \nbanks rather than only a few, especially for forecasting? \n \n1) Information loss: Using only one s\npecification or model implies that some indicators and information ar\ne left aside and ignored for policy decisions. There are good reasons for thinking that this may not be a good strategy.6  \nIn applied econometrics typically alternative specifications are initially tried, and the specification, estimati\non and testing steps are re-iterated a number of times.7 In this way, a ‚good™ forecasting model is obtained by an extensive specification search. By \nchecking a large number of possible models, and choosing exclusively the \nbest-performing one, specifications with only slightly inferior empirical performance are subsequently ignored \nin the forecast comparison. As a consequence, there is the danger that a good forecast performance is less t\nhe result of the model™s actual forecasting ability, but more so just luck in the selection procedure. Better                                            \n 4 See Kapetanios, Labhard, and Price (2005). \n5 See Adolfson, Andersson, Lindé, Villani, and Vredin (2005). \n6 See Granger and Jeon (2004), pp. 324-5.", "Embargo: 5 May, 2006, 09:00 a.m. local time \n  Page 7 of 20 \ntesting procedures should consider mo\nre general specification search \ncriteria such as ﬁthe benchmark™s \nforecast performance should not be inferior to any alternative forecastﬂ. \nForecast comparison tests considering \nthis general requirement have recently been proposed by White (2000) and Hansen (2005), and take into account a large number of candidate models for forecasting.8  \nA similar idea is adopted in the ‚model confidence set™ (MCS) approach proposed by Hansen, Lunde and Nason (2003). This procedure represents a general approach to model selection which allows for finding a group (set) of forecasting models. This is appealing because it often cannot be ruled out a priori that more than one of the competing model is equally good.9 *  \nTherefore, a sensible solution in the forecasting model selection context is \nto consider many competing models, and not just a few.  \n \n2) Model uncertainty: Policymakers fa\nce a wide range of uncertainty, and \nso do modellers. There is considerable model uncertainty, and there is no \n\nconsensus among policymakers conc\nerning the one true model. As an \nexample, consider the different approaches to modeling expectations; \nsome authors favour backward-looking models while \nothers prefer forward-looking models, and a third \ncamp advocates hybrid models. Therefore, model equations may be misspecified in terms of functional form or omitted variables. Additio\nnally, structural breaks have been                                                                                                                        \n 7 See Spanos (2001). \n8 Taking into account more than one benchmark model makes the null of equal forecast \naccuracy harder to reject. See, for ex\nample, White (2000), table 1, p. 1113. \n9 Construction of an MCS involves a sequence \nof tests for equal predictive ability. This \nrestricts the set of candidate models by deleting models that are found to be \nsignificantly inferior, and the set of remaining models is the MCS. An MCS can be \nused to construct combination forecasts by pooling the forecasts of the models in the \n\nMCS. If the number of models in the MCS is \nlarge, a reasonable way to proceed is to \nweigh the individual forecasts equally. The reason for this is that the MCS consists \nprecisely of the models that cannot be re\njected as being equally good. See Hansen, \nLunde and Nason (2003), p. 841.", "Embargo: 5 May, 2006, 09:00 a.m. local time \n  Page 8 of 20 \nidentified as crucial sources of forecast failure. Finally, data uncertainty might affect models in different ways.   \nInformation loss and model uncertainty\n are closely interdependent: Models are, by definition, a reduction of rea\nlity. For example, single models can capture only a few aspects of the monetary transmission mechanism. Since many transmission channels are likely to matter in reality, a ﬁone model fits allﬂ approach seems inappropriate. \n\n \n3) Forecast pooling performs well in empirical applications: Forecast combination methods often work well, and, in particular, better than single-model forecasts. Recent examples of the empirical success of forecast pooling are Stock and Watson (2004) and \nMarcellino (2004). Intriguingly, \nthe combination methods with the lowest forecast errors are the simplest Œ \nfor example, with equal weights. This indicates that estimating forecast \nweights might be difficult in practice, but in itself again is probably method sensitive. \n \nForecast pooling may be particularly useful under structural changes or breaks and misspecification: Following theoretical considerations, combinations of forecasts are unnecessary when forecasts use the correct conditional expectation in\n a weakly-stationary process. In other words, a departure from perfect knowledge is necessary to explain gains from combination, see Clements and Hendry (2002) and Timmermann (2005):   A pro-diversification argument \nstates that some combination of two-model forecasts might perform better than either alone, if the two models provide partial, but not overlapping, explanations.10   Owing to model uncertainty, using the correct conditional \nexpectation for forecasting is unrealistic, and, in reality,                                            \n 10 See Timmermann (2005), p. 3.", "Embargo: 5 May, 2006, 09:00 a.m. local time \n  Page 9 of 20 \ndepartures from the correct model may be expected to be the rule rather than the exception.  If structural breaks occur, fo\nrecasts from individual models may be affected differently , possibly on account of differing \n\ndegrees of misspecification. Comb\ninations of forecasts might then outperform forecasts from individual models.11   \nTo summarize: There are good reasons why monetary policy pursues full-information strategies and ﬁlooks at everythingﬂ in terms of a broad set of information from data and models. The recent sizable literature on robust policies in various model environment\ns also emphasises the merits of \nmodel combination and averaging.12   \nTherefore, selecting a single model for monetary policy may be inappropriate, since conditioning monetary policy decisions on one model \nignores the role of model uncertainty. It also disregards the favourable empirical results from the forecast combination literature, and  thus leaves aside potentially important information.  \n \n 3 Eurosystem forecasting \nThe Governing Council of the Eurosystem bases its comprehensive \nassessment of the risks to price stability and its policy decisions on a broad set of information provided by two analytical tools: the economic analysis and the monetary analysis.  \n                                           \n 11 See Clements and Hendry (2002). \n12 For example, Brock, Durlauf and West \n(2003, 2006) propose a model averaging \napproach that derives optimal policy given a \npolicy maker™s preferences Œ for example, \na loss function Œ and given a variety of pos\nsibly relevant models affecting the central \nbank™s target values. Apart from forecast \naveraging, a multiple model approach helps \nto address other issues where model uncertainty matters. For example, a policymaker \nmay be interested in policies whose effects are relatively insensitive to which model is \nthe correct one.", "Embargo: 5 May, 2006, 09:00 a.m. local time \n  Page 10 of 20 \n The monetary analysis assesses medium to long-term developments in inflation based on the close relationship between money and prices over \nlong horizons. Monetary analysis takes into account developments in a wide range of monetary indicators including M3, its components and counterparts, notably credit, and measures of excess liquidity.  \nThe economic analysis identifies short to medium-term risks to price \nstability. It includes regular monito\nring of a broad set of non-monetary economic and financial variables, such as labour costs, fiscal policy statistics and financial market indicators.13   \nAdditionally, the projections of ke\ny macroeconomic variables carried out by Eurosystem staff are an integral\n part of the economic analysis. \nMoreover, a range of non-central bank forecasts are taken into consideration. Forecasts, however, are not an all-encompassing tool for the conduct of monetary policy in the Eurosystem. \n \nThe monetary and economic analyses provide complementary analytical frameworks, and, by means of cross-checking, they support the robustness of the Governing Council™s assessment of risks to price \nstability.  \n \nEurosystem forecasts are carried out \nunder the sole responsibility of the \nEurosystem staff, and not of the Governing Council. This makes the forecasts different from those of other central banks, such as the forecasts of the Bank of England, where the MPC is responsible for the forecasts and their assumptions.  \n \nThe regular staff projections are carri\ned out as a collaboration between the \nECB and the national central banks of t\nhe euro area. This ensures the full                                            \n 13 See Issing (2004), p. 725.", "Embargo: 5 May, 2006, 09:00 a.m. local time \n  Page 11 of 20 \nconsideration of all information and expertise available in the Eurosystem for forecasting, in addition to aggregate \ninformation at the area-wide level.   \nEmpirical results from the forecasting \nliterature also support the argument that disaggregated information in terms of national time series is more useful for forecasting than aggregated information (area-wide time series) in the euro area.14   \nConcerning the forecast methods, various approaches are employed, and \nthe Eurosystem pursues a suite-of-m\nodels approach. Regarding the level of aggregation, the Eurosystem employs econometric models for single \n\neuro area member countries in addition to area-wide approaches. \nTraditional structural macroeconometri\nc models still play a key role in \nforecasting Œ for example, the Area-wide-model (AWM) of the ECB Œ and the econometric models of the euro-area central banks.   \nRecently, DSGE models have been developed in the Eurosystem. Some \nof these models are still under construc\ntion and some are already used for \npolicy simulations. However, they have not been widely used for \nforecasting so far.  \n \nIn addition, Eurosystem staff makes use \nof time series models for short-term forecasting, such as different VAR models and large factor models.  \nHowever, Eurosystem forecasts are not \nfully model-based. In the forecast \nexercises conducted by the Eurosystem, a complex interaction of \n\ninformation takes place between models and judgmental information from outside the models.  \n                                            \n 14 See Marcellino, Stock and Watson (2004).", "Embargo: 5 May, 2006, 09:00 a.m. local time \n  Page 12 of 20 \n3.1 The role of short-term interest \nrates in central bank projections \nOne practical difficulty in forecast exercises is the appropriate conditioning \nof the forecasts. A particularly subtle problem for central banks concerns \nthe appropriate choice of a consistent\n short-term interest-rate projection. This topic plays a key role in the recent discussion on central bank \nforecasting. The short-term rate is the policy instrument under the control of the central bank; via the expectation channel, its future path influences current economic circumstances and decisions. Specifying a trajectory of future rates in today™s projections is therefore a delicate problem with \nregard to the signals about the future course of monetary policy given to \noutside observers. There are basically three ways of specifying the future \n\ninterest rate path. \n \nFirstly, a constant short-term inte\nrest rate (CIR) assumption can be employed. The inflation projection being higher (lower) than the inflation target at some given horizon has been interpreted as indicating that, sooner or later, the instrument rate needs to be raised (lowered).15 An \nadvantage of this assumption is that it can easily be communicated. CIR is an obviously technical assumption with no risk of central bank commitment \n\nto following the assumed constant interest rate path.   \nOne drawback is that many current asset prices depend on market \nexpectations of the future short-term interest rate path Œ the most prominent example being the long-term interest rate which, via the term structure, depends on expectations of future short term rates. And, typically, the market prices of these assets are used as other inputs in \nprojection exercises rather than the hy\npothetical asset prices that would result if market participants actually\n expected a constant interest rate. \nHence, the forecasts are of a hybrid nature as they use the CIR together with inputs which are inconsistent with the CIR assumption.", "Embargo: 5 May, 2006, 09:00 a.m. local time \n  Page 13 of 20 \nSecondly, an alternative is using the market expectations of future short-term interest rates, the so-called ma\nrket interest rates approach (MIR), \nwhere these are typically derived from the yield curve. Compared with the \nCIR, the MIR assumption in principle preserves a higher degree of internal \nconsistency as it is in line with \nthe other asset price inputs for the forecasts. Therefore, it could be expected to be a better estimate of future outcomes than projections based on the CIR assumption, while remaining a technical assumption and not a policy commitment on the part of the \ncentral bank as regards the future evolution of its policy rate.   \nUntil now, the Eurosystem forecasts have been carried out under the \n\nassumptions of a CIR. Starting in June 2006, Eurosystem and ECB staff \nmacroeconomic projections will be based on the technical assumption that short-term market interest rates will \nmove in line with market expectations and thus follow the MIR approach.\n16   \nNote that the change to MIR is of a purely technical nature. It should not be misunderstood as a commitment of future interest rate policy to the rates assumed in the projections. The MIR is being introduced in order to \nbring about a further improvement in \nthe quality and internal consistency \nof the macroeconomic projections, \nand does not imply any change in the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosyst\nem or in the role of projections \nwithin it. The Governing Council will continue to base its assessment of \nthe risks to price stability and its policy decisions on a broad set of \ninformation provided by the economic and monetary analyses. \n \nA third possible concept to treat the \nshort-term rate in central bank™s \nprojections is the ‚own instrument projection™. It reflects the central bank™s own assumed interest rate path (OIR), i.e. the interest rate path that is \nsupposed to achieve the central bank™s objectives best under certain                                                                                                                        \n 15 See Svensson (2005). \n16 ECB (2006).", "Embargo: 5 May, 2006, 09:00 a.m. local time \n  Page 14 of 20 \nmodel- and judgment-based assumptions concerning the functioning of the economy.   \nThe OIR approach necessitates the commitment of the decision-making \nbody to this conditional forecast. Given that the Eurosystem staff \nprojections are under the sole responsibility of the \nstaff, and not the Governing Council, the adoption of a OI\nR forecast is no viable option for the Eurosystem. \n \nMoreover, although the OIR has the appealing property of being fully consistent with the central bank™s \ntargets and other inputs there are several problems with this approach. They can explain why only very few \n\ncentral banks are pursuing this alter\nnative. The OIR is highly dependent on the specific analytical framework from which it is derived; in particular, a \ncore forward-looking model and a monetary policy loss function. In light of \nadditional model-uncertainty and the nec\nessary integration of judgment in the forecasting process the optimal interest rate is therefore surrounded by difficult-to-quantify uncertainties which make it somewhat problematic to \ncommunicate. Moreover, the OIR might\n be interpreted as an unconditional commitment to the future path. Therefore, communicating the conditional \nnature of the assumption is more demanding than for the other two assumptions.  \n \n 3.2 Future Challenges for Eurosystem forecasting \nLooking to the future, the Eurosystem will face various challenges with \nrespect to forecasting. Of course, in order to provide the best possible forecasts as inputs for monetary policy decisions, there is a constant need \nfor the use of the latest forecast methods in the Eurosystem macroeconomic projection exercises.\n For this purpose, extensive \nevaluation studies of recently developed forecasting methods are", "Embargo: 5 May, 2006, 09:00 a.m. local time \n  Page 15 of 20 \nnecessary, which might lead to extensions of the forecasting toolkit where appropriate.  \nIn this regard, an important question will be how to integrate new \napproaches into the forecasting procedures. For example: What are the \nbenefits and risks of recently develope\nd DSGE models for forecasting Œ and for policy analysis? Can they be integrated into the forecasting \n\nprocedures, and how can the results be communicated? \n\n \nMoreover, another central direction for future work might be the adoption of formal forecast and model combination methods to take account of model uncertainty in an effective manner\n and to make efficient use of the large datasets that are nowadays avai\nlable for forecasting at central \nbanks. Research projects on dimension reduction using model selection, large factor modelling or systematic \nforecast and model combination are \nalready under way and might also play an important role in the future.  \nThese topics are particularly useful fo\nr short-term economic forecasting in the Eurosystem in order to identify \nshort to medium-term risks to price \nstability under the economic analysis.  \n\n \nWith regard to longer-term horizons and forecasting, two possible innovations may be considered \nvaluable for future work. \n \nFirstly, owing to the well-established \nempirical relationship between money and future price developments,17 money-based inflation forecasts could be envisaged as an additional tool to support the monetary analysis of future risks to price stability. \n\n                                            \n 17 See, for example, the various approaches\n used to establish the role of money for \nfuture inflation by Gerlach and Svensson (2003), Gerlach (2004), Gerlach-Kristen \n\n(2005), and Hofmann (2006).", "Embargo: 5 May, 2006, 09:00 a.m. local time \n  Page 16 of 20 \nSecondly, conditional on implementing \nthe former it might also be worth \ninvestigating the usefulness of model averaging approaches for refining \nthe overall formal background of the ECB strategy.  \n \nAs discussed earlier, the ultimate goal\n of the Eurosystem™s two-pillar strategy is the efficient utilisation of available information for monetary \npolicy decisions under the monet\nary and economic analyses. One possible extension might be found in a more strongly formalised combined assessment of the information included in both pillars for future inflation \n\ndevelopments at various time horizons (short, medium and long-term).  \n \nOf course, the advantages and pitfalls of a more formalised forecasting combination have to be investigated \nthoroughly, and research activities are needed for that.  \n 4 Bundesbank forecasting within the Eurosystem  \nThe Bundesbank, as part of the Euro\nsystem, carries out forecasts on a regular basis for the key German macroeconomic variables. These \n\nforecasts are an input for the Eurosystem staff projections, where the \n\nnational predictions are discusse\nd and aggregated with other national forecasts into area-wide forecasts. Furthermore, the forecasts serve as quantitative background information for explaining monetary policy on a national level, and for comments on \neconomic and fiscal policy issues. \n From a methodological viewpoint, forecasts are carried out as a combination of model-based forecasting and judgmental forecasting. The core model for policy forecasting is the structural macroeconometric model, which is used in the Eurosystem staff projection exercises.", "Embargo: 5 May, 2006, 09:00 a.m. local time \n  Page 17 of 20 \nTo date, only the Bundesbank model has served as the main model forecasting tool, but further steps towards a suite-of-models approach are \nbeing explored and likely to be im\nplemented in the near future.  \nCurrent research projects aim at developing DSGE models for policy simulation. However, owing to the \nlimited forecast accuracy of these models so far, they will probably serve only as a tool for analysing \nparticular policy-relevant issues apart from being used, for now, in regular forecast exercises.  \n \nShort-term forecasting in the Bundesbank is carried out with bridge \nequations and other time series model\ns. However, in order to enhance these models, efforts are being made to develop models suitable for forecasting in real time Œ in particular, large factor models and VAR \nmodels and their applications in real time. \n \nMoreover, the Bundesbank is devoting c\nonsiderable research activities to \nthe further development of the monetary analysis. In particular, ongoing research projects are investigating \nthe information content of various monetary aggregates for future inflation.  \n 5 Outlook for the conference \nAs you can see, topics concerning forecasting methodology are always at the top of the research agenda for Eurosystem central banks. I have \nhighlighted some aspects that lie at the heart of each and every central bank engaged in forecasting, and I have mentioned a number of issues \nthat are particularly relevant to the \nstate of play in the Eurosystem in \ngeneral and the Bundesbank in particular\n. Of course, there are still more open questions than issues resolved. But \nif it were the other way round,", "Embargo: 5 May, 2006, 09:00 a.m. local time \n  Page 18 of 20 \nconferences like this would be superfluous.
