It led to a worl\ndwide slump in economic activity and, in \n2010, sparked a serious sovereign debt crisis \nin some euro-area mem\nber countries. This \ncourse of events demonstrated t\nhe global character of the fi\nnancial system Œ crises are no \nlonger a purely national issue Œ and theref\nore underscored the need for an internationally \ncoordinated reform of regulatory and supervisor\ny frameworks. Let me very briefly discuss \nthe issue of globalising regulation and supervision from a Eur\nopean perspective. 2 Reforming the regulatory framework \nThe regulatory reform has three main build\ning blocks: first, Basel III as an enhanced \nregulatory framework for banks.\n Second, new rules for system\nically important financial", "Embargo: Wednesday, 23 March, 9:30 am CET\n  Page 3 of 5 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \ninstitutions (SIFIs) and, th\nird, adequate regulation \nof the shadow bankin\ng sector. The G20 endorsed Basel III in November 2010.\n As regards the other two areas, intensive discussions \nare ongoing, and results should emerge later this y\near. At a general level,\n there is no doubt \nthat an internationally harmoni\nsed approach is necessary in al\nl three areas. Given the global nature of the financial system, \na fragmented approach would invi\nte regulatory arbitrage and \nthus provoke the renewed build-up of systemic risk in less regulated jurisdictions. Nonetheless, uniform international principles\n have to be adapted to heterogeneous national \nstructures. Specific national\n legislation typically take\ns better account of national \nparticularities, for example in terms of mark\net structure or modes\n of refinancing. The \nchallenge is therefore to stri\nke the right balance between en\nsuring a level international \nplaying field and avoiding a one-size-fits-all approach that plac\nes an unnecessarily onerous, \nor even harmful, burden of adjustment on national\n financial systems. W\nhether this would be \nthe case in the EU if the Basel III framewor\nk is implemented through \nthe instrument of a \nregulation rather than a direct\nive is currently a hotly debated\n issue. For the European \nCommission, it would definitely be easier \nto enforce common standards through a \nregulation, but this approach would leave only \nvery limited leeway for member states to \naccommodate country-level differences or to \ndeal with any unintended\n consequences that \nemerge after the rules have come into effect. 3 Reforming the supervisory framework \nThe reform of supervisory structures involves a \nsimilar trade-off, though it\n is tilted somewhat \nmore in favour of national parti\ncularities; national supervisors nat\nurally have a more intimate \nknowledge of local financial inst\nitutions than supranational supe\nrvisors. Nevertheless, it is", "Embargo: Wednesday, 23 March, 9:30 am CET\n  Page 4 of 5 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nclear from the experiences of \nthe crisis that financial supervi\nsion requires a higher degree of \ninternational cooperation: fi\nrstly because international banks \noperate and are supervised in \ndifferent jurisdictions; and secondly because \nof potential systemic risks, which are \npredominantly a cross-border phenomenon. \nTo facilitate the supervision of internat\nional banks, the European \nSystem of Financial \nSupervisors (ESFS) has been set up. Part of th\nis system is the Euro\npean Banking Authority (EBA), which is responsible for supervising \nthe banking sector. To allow for adequate \nsubsidiarity, the EBA follows a members-ba\nsed approach where national supervisors are \nmembers of boards and working groups. With regard to systemic risk, establishing inter\nnational cooperation is \nparticularly important. \nTo strengthen the macroprudent\nial approach which supplements the traditional \nmicroprudential approach, the focus of supervision has to be broadened from the level of the \nindividual bank to the systemic \nlevel. This can and will be ac\nhieved by various means. \nInstitutionally, an important el\nement is the European System\nic Risk Board (ESRB), which \nhas been created as part of the ESFS. Its task is\n to detect systemic risks early on and to \nissue individual member stat\nes with warnings and recommendat\nions. Nevertheless, as the \nESRB has no powers to enforce its recomm\nendations, it remains the responsibility of \nnational governments to ensure that recommendations are followed. 4 The role of central banks \nNow, as a last point, let me say a few word\ns on the role of cent\nral banks in this new \nregulatory and supervisory framework. Naturally, central banks have a strong interest in \nfinancial stability, as only a stable financial \nsystem allows monetary \npolicy measures to be", "Embargo: Wednesday, 23 March, 9:30 am CET\n  Page 5 of 5 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nimplemented efficiently. At the same time, cent\nral banks have great expertise in all matters \nconcerning the financial system. \nConsequently, they already pl\nay, and should continue to \nplay, a prominent role in safeguarding financial \nstability at the micropr\nudential as well as at \nthe macroprudential level. At t\nhe microprudential level, central \nbanks in many countries are \ninvolved in the supervision of individual ban\nks. In addition, they naturally analyse \ndevelopments at the macroprudential level extensively and conseque\nntly play a major role in the ESRB. However, wherever central banks ar\ne involved in financial \nsupervision, it is \nimperative that this does not \ncompromise their independence \nand their primary objective, \nwhich is to maintain price stability. 5 Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen There is no doubt that the r\negulatory and supervisory framewor\nk has to reflect the global \nnature of the financial system. \nNonetheless, heterogeneous nation\nal structures make it \nimperative to maintain a certain degree of \nflexibility when reforming regulation and \nsupervision. To strike the balance between uni\nformity and subsidiarity is certainly a \nformidable challenge but I am c\nonfident that we wil\nl eventually succeed and create a more \nstable and more resilient financial system.
