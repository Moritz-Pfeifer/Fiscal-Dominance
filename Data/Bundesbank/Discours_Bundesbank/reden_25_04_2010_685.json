But it also set in motion a \nprocess that will lead to the creation of a more st\nable and more resilient financial system in \nthe future. As warranted by the global character of\n the crisis, this process has found a sound \ninternational basis in the G20, bringing together m\najor advanced as well as emerging \neconomies. Nevertheless, the G20 Agenda is not just\n a response to the financial crisis but \nalso a response to the needs of a globalised world.\n Consequently, the agenda covers a \nbroad range of topics such as the realisation of a \nmore balanced pattern of global economic \ngrowth, the reform of the international financial i\nnstitutions, and the strengthening of financial \nregulation. Whereas a lot could be said about the f\nirst part and the sometimes overly \nambitious and activist policy recommendations assoc\niated with it, I would like to focus on the \nlast-named aspect for the remainder of my speech.", "Page 3 of 5\n Deutsche Bundesbank \n· Communications Department \n· Wilhelm-Epstein-Straße 14 \n· 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n· Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de \n· E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n· Tel.: +49 69 9566-3511 \n· Fax: +49 69 9566-3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated \n2 Major issues in the reform process \nWith regard to financial regulation, a comprehensiv\ne reform agenda was set in train by the \nG20 summits in Washington, London and Pittsburgh. T\nhe envisaged reforms aim at creating \na strong regulatory framework that ensures financia\nl stability and supports steady and \nsustainable economic growth. Although significant p\nrogress has already been made, much \nremains to be done. As the implementation of the ag\nreed rules is what finally counts, 2010 \nand 2011 will prove to be crucial years. \nWhat have been the main achievements up to now? The\n major step has been the reform of \nthe Basel II framework for capital and liquidity re\ngulation. Relevant proposals were put \nforward in December 2009, including, among other th\nings, measures to raise the quality, \nconsistency and transparency of the capital base, a\n global standard for funding liquidity as \nwell as the introduction of a leverage ratio. Throu\nghout 2010 the proposed measures will be \ncalibrated on the basis of an extensive quantitativ\ne impact study. The fully calibrated set of \nmeasures will then be issued by the end of 2010 and\n the new standards will be phased in by \nthe end of 2012 provided that economic recovery is \nassured. \nOther major elements of reform centre on the proble\nm of systemically important financial \ninstitutions. Here, the reform of the Basel framewo\nrk is part of the solution, too, as it will help \nto improve the capacity of such institutions to abs\norb losses. However, what is required is a \nmore comprehensive approach which specifically ensu\nres that accountability is brought \nback into the game. Necessary proposals that go bey\nond the reformed capital and liquidity \nframework include capital surcharges for systemical\nly important institutions, better resolution \nregimes and a strengthening of the financial infras\ntructure. Commissioned by the G20, the \nFSB is already working towards that goal. Neverthel\ness, some thorny issues are still waiting \nto be resolved, such as the calibration of measures\n to assess systemic relevance.", "Page 4 of 5\n Deutsche Bundesbank \n· Communications Department \n· Wilhelm-Epstein-Straße 14 \n· 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n· Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de \n· E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n· Tel.: +49 69 9566-3511 \n· Fax: +49 69 9566-3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated \nWhile traditional microprudential supervision is st\nill important, the crisis has taught us that it \nis far from being sufficient for effective crisis p\nrevention. Thus, the microprudential approach \nhas to be supplemented by macroprudential supervisi\non that takes due account of systemic \nrisk and the overall stability of the financial sys\ntem. Towards that end, material progress has \nbeen made on the European level by establishing the\n European Systemic Risk Board and \nthe European System of Financial Supervisors. Yet a\ngain, further efforts are required. \n3 The role of the private sector \nThe few remarks I have just made show that the agen\nda set by the G20 is an ambitious \nendeavour for governments and regulatory authoritie\ns. Even so, it is important not to leave \nthe private sector on the sidelines. Market partici\npants are also in charge and have to \ncontribute to the reform process. This is all the m\nore true since the reform agenda also \nstrives to strengthen or re-establish the disciplin\ning effect of market forces. \nHence, despite the fact that markets are stabilisin\ng and recovery is lingering on the \ndoorstep, going back to ﬁbusiness as usualﬂ cannot \nbe the way forward. Rather, market \nparticipants should seize the opportunity provided \nby the current favourable times to \nstrengthen their risk-bearing capacities and to bui\nld up adequate buffers. This is especially \nimportant as regulatory changes such as higher capi\ntal and liquidity requirements, while still \nto be phased in, are definitely on the way. \nIn this context, I can assure you that recent compl\naints about regulatory uncertainty posing a \nmajor downside risk to financial institutions are b\neing taken seriously. However, as the \ndecisions to be taken will shape the financial syst\nem for years to come, accuracy is more \nimportant than speed. We have to be careful not to \nimplement oversimplistic solutions.", "Page 5 of 5\n Deutsche Bundesbank \n· Communications Department \n· Wilhelm-Epstein-Straße 14 \n· 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n· Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de \n· E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n· Tel.: +49 69 9566-3511 \n· Fax: +49 69 9566-3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated \nRegarding the required complexity of regulatory mea\nsures, potential interactions have to be \ntaken into account as, otherwise, the danger of uni\nntended consequences grows. At the \nsame time, the cumulative effect of new measures ha\ns to be considered, which makes \nthorough impact assessments necessary. Also, action\ns have to be sufficiently coordinated \non the global level in order to maintain a level pl\naying field and to reduce the risks stemming \nfrom a fragmented and piecemeal regulatory response\n. Even so, policy development is \nproceeding to agreed Œ and very ambitious Œ timelin\nes, thereby reducing regulatory \nuncertainty as far as possible. \n4 Conclusion \nLadies and gentlemen \nGiven the magnitude of the challenges that lie ahea\nd of us, it seems fair to say that we have \ncome a good distance already. However, there are a \ncouple of things we have to be aware \nof: first of all, it is essential that the process \nof reform remains an international endeavour \nand is not hampered by unilateralist leanings. Also\n, as we are now hopefully entering better \ntimes, there is a certain danger that some major is\nsues on the reform agenda might fall prey \nto dwindling commitment and political interests. Th\nis must not be allowed to happen as only \na coordinated and harmonised effort will enable us \nto ensure financial stability and thus \npave the way for steady and sustainable global deve\nlopment. \nThank you for your attention. \n*    *    *"], "SECTION": "reden", "RECORD_ID": 685}
