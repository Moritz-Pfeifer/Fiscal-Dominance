Anniversary \ncelebrations are usually an \nopportunity to look back on this period, to\n honour the achievements and remember what \nmight have been done better. However, given the gl\nobal financial crisis, it is impossible to \nconfine oneself to this retros\npective view. We have to find ways of how to respond to today™s \nfinancial market challenges. This is exactly what the Bank Negara Malaysia is doing by host-\ning this conference on Central Banking in the \n21st century and I am very glad to have been \ninvited to contribute to the discussion by talk\ning about moral hazard, \nmarket discipline and \nself-regulation.  These issues take centre-stage in global talks \non crisis prevention. As the current financial \ncrisis dramatically shows, neither market pa\nrticipants nor the global\n regulatory framework \nhave kept pace with the expansion and innovative fo\nrces of the global financial markets. At \npresent, regulators, central banker\ns, and market participants all ov\ner the world are trying to \nidentify the causes of the crisis\n and search for lessons to be l\nearnt from it. While resolute", "Page 3 of 9  Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \npolitical decisions are indispensable when it \ncomes to immediate crisis management, it will \ntake much more time and effort \nto identify and remedy the caus\nes of the financial turmoil. \nFor this reason, I will not present you complete \nformulas today but I will try to highlight some \ncritical issues that need further \nattention. But first, let me br\niefly outline the theoretical con-\ncepts of moral hazard, market discipline and self-regulation. 2 Theoretical Overview \nMoral Hazard - In order to illustrate the concept of \nmoral hazard, I would like to look at the \nprocess of credit risk transfer in the form of se\ncuritisation, which play\ned a key role in the \nevents leading to the current financial crisis. \nPrincipally, credit risk transfer is a very benefi-\ncial means of allocating risk in the financial mark\net as it disconnects t\nhe originator of a risky \nasset from the ultimate risk-taker. The downside of this separation is, however, that once the \ncredit risk is forwarded there is no incentive for \nthe originator to monitor the debtor. This is \nwhat we call moral hazard and what has ultima\ntely resulted in an erosion of credit standards \nnot only in US subprime but al\nso in other credit market segm\nents. In general, the ultimate \nrisk-taker does not have the necessary informati\non to monitor the debtor and the transfer \nprocess unnecessarily complicates the default \nrisk assessment of the securitised assets.  Market discipline \n- Market discipline describes a mechani\nsm in which market participants \nhave an incentive to monitor the risk behaviour of\n counterparties with t\nhe aim of readjusting \ntheir investment decisions accordingly. In the aforementioned case of \nsecuritisation, the risk-taker might be penalised by its share holders and ot\nher counterparties if a lack of monitoring \nimpairs his ability to assess cr\nedit risk properly. Hence, market \ndiscipline has the potential to \ncorrect inefficiencies arising from credit risk trans\nfer. However, there is\n a very important pre-\nrequisite for market discipline: transparency. Only\n if the market partici\npants recognise that a \nmoral hazard problem is arising \nwill they have the option of adj\nusting their investment deci-\nsions accordingly. While transparency is a necessary\n condition for market discipline, it is by \nno means sufficient on its own. \nIn addition, market participants \nmust have the ability and in-", "Page 4 of 9  Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \ncentive to use the information. Especially in ti\nmes of economic expansi\non, the incentive to \nacquire and use the information \nmight be low as the general def\nault risk remains relatively \nmuted as long as the upward trend continues. A re\nstraining effect via market discipline is \nrather unlikely in this case. Therefore, trans\nparency and market discipline can sustain finan-\ncial stability but they should not\n replace market regulation. In \naddition, market regulation it-\nself is necessary for enhancing transparency.  \n Self-regulation - In general, there are two possible paths\n that can be followed with regard \nto market regulation. Regulation\n can either be imposed on the rele\nvant institutions in the fi-\nnancial sector by regulator age\nncies or the institutions t\nhemselves can willingly agree on \nregulation. In the second case, we are talki\nng about self-regulation. Self-regulation has the \nadvantage that market par\nticipants tend to identif\ny with the self-imposed rules, which should \nresult in a higher acceptance \nof the regulation. Moreover, \nmarket participants might have \nbetter knowledge of the market, \nleading to more flexible and le\nss costly solutions. However, \nas the current financial crisis underscores, se\nlf-regulation bears the risk \nthat regulation will \nremain too lax or that the market participants\n will not comply with the self-imposed rules. \nThis is an example of the well-\nknown problem of collective action. Consequently, it has to be \ndecided carefully whether self-regulation can be sufficient for a well-defined field of finance. 3 What have we learnt? \nLet me now turn to some specific aspects that \nI consider to be crucia\nl in the learning proc-\ness that we are currently\n undergoing. First, I would like to \ntalk about some regulatory issues, \nasking how we can enhanc\ne transparency and market disciplin\ne in the securitisation market \nand financial institutions. Then, \nI would like to focus on the ro\nle that monetary policy can \nplay in preventing future financial crises.", "Page 5 of 9  Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n3.1 Regulation \nSecuritisation - The securitisation market has played a \ncritical role in the financial crisis. \nPrior to the crisis, a lack of transparency in th\nis market aggravated wron\ng incentives in the \noriginate-to-distribute business model. As credit risk was well\n hidden in highly structured \nproducts, it was easily transferred to\n other market partici\npants. This in turn increased the in-\ncentive to originate credit risk.\n Consequently, credit standards \ndeteriorated, contributing to \noverheating phenomena such as those seen on the American housing and loan market. The \nfact that market participants often relied sole\nly on credit ratings and that these ratings did \nnot always capture the credit risk adequately aggrav\nated the situation. Once the crisis had \nbegun, the lack of information on t\nhe risk profile and profitabilit\ny of the highly structured \nproducts increased the distrust among market \nparticipants, thus aggrav\nating the financial turmoil.  In order to revive this largely beneficial mark\net, a necessary condition is to restore confi-\ndence among market participants by enhancing \nmarket transparency. The transparency and \nquality of credit ratings is definitely one starting \npoint in this process. I would like to stress \nthat credit ratings should never \nreplace the investor™s responsibil\nity to evaluate the risk of a \nfinancial product. But transparency in the rating pr\nocess Œ especially in the segment of often \nopaque and multilayered structured \ncredit Œ is a prerequisite fo\nr investors to behave respon-\nsibly. Only a sufficiently transparent rating pr\nocess that represents negat\nive incentive effects for rating agencies will enable the investors to\n make informed judgements about the product \ncharacteristics as well as the quality of the \nrating process itself. It should be mentioned in \nthis context that initiatives led by IOSCO, the \ninternational organisation of securities supervi-\nsors, point in the right direction.\n In the course of this month, IOSCO is expected to report on \nimprovements of transparency prov\nisions in individual Codes \nof Conducts of credit rating \nagencies. Another issue at stake is the lack of market\n standards in the securi\ntisation market. Market participants must have easy access Œ for example,\n via a central data portal Œ to information \non transactions in the securitisation market, t\nhe underlying asset portfolio and further trans-", "Page 6 of 9  Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nformation of the securitisation. The informati\non provided should include, among other things, \ndetails about any retent\nion of a share of securitised produc\nts on the balance sheet of the \noriginator. This would reveal \nthe originator™s incentive stru\ncture and thus unveil possible \nmoral hazard problems. In addition, there is \nstrong need for international harmonisation of \ncommon terminology as well as \ndisclosure requirements.  \nAt present, there seems to be \na consensus among regulating inst\nitutions and market partici-\npants about the necessity of these standards. The \nInstitute of International Finance (IIF), a \nglobal association of financial institutions, has\n stressed in its final report on market best \npractices the need for common information standards\n in the market for securitised products. \nTheir package of measures is largely consis\ntent with the aforemen\ntioned requirements. Moreover, there are initiatives underway from \nboth the American Securitization Forum (ASF) \nand the European Securitisation Forum (ESF) to develop disclosure requirements for secu-\nritisations.  The Bundesbank welcomes these \ninitiatives and is watching th\ne process carefully. We hope \nthat market participants in t\nhe securitisation market will agr\nee on and abide by strong self-\nregulation. Otherwise, \nlegal disclosure requirements will \nhave to be implemented globally. \n \nFinancial institutions - Another important starting point \nfor transparency-enhancing regula-tion is the treatment of special \npurpose vehicles founded by financi\nal institutions in order to \ntransfer their credit risk off their balance sheets. In\n the course of the crisis, a significant loss \nof confidence in the money ma\nrket resulted from the construc\ntion of these off-balance-sheet \nvehicles. As their business mode\nl is built on maturity transfo\nrmation, they have run into li-\nquidity problems when money market froze dur\ning the crisis and, owing to reputation con-\ncerns, the banks had to take them back onto t\nheir balance sheets. Thus, huge risks that had \npreviously been invisible sud\ndenly reappeared on the balance s\nheets of financial institu-\ntions, revealing a severe case of insufficient transparency.  Transparency requirements for financial institutions arise from \naccounting standards™ disclo-\nsure requirements as well as from prudential ru\nles for banking supervision. With regard to", "Page 7 of 9  Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \naccounting standards, international and national ambitions ar\ne to change the legal frame-\nwork such that financial institutions must c\nonsolidate their off-balance-sheet vehicles. For \nboth the international financia\nl reporting standards (IFRS) and \nfor German accounting rules \nin accordance with the Commercial Code \n(HGB), legislation amendments are underway. \nAdditionally, the Basel Committee on Banking \nSupervision recently proposed revisions to \nthe existing pillar 3 requirements of Basel II, whic\nh aim at helping market\n participants to bet-\nter understand a bank's overall risk profile, comp\nrising, for example, \nrequirements to dis-\nclose involvement in off-balance-sheet vehicles\n. In my view, these steps are essential for \nenhancing transparency in t\nhe financial markets.  3.2 Monetary Policy \nSo far, I have focused on regulatory issues that\n are relevant for the \nstability of the financial \nsystem. I would now like to turn to the part that\n monetary policy plays in this respect. In or-\nder to identify this contributi\non, an analysis of the \nmonetary policy in the years preceding the \ncrisis is essential. Different \nanalytical methods Œ such as a \ncomparison of central bank inter-\nest rates with the forecast of a \nTaylor rule Œ point to the fact \nthat monetary policy in most in-\ndustrialised countries has followed \na rather expansionary stance \nin the second half of this \ndecade. This was particularly the case in the \nUSA after the New Economy bubble had burst. \nHowever, in the euro area, t\noo, interest-based as well as \nmoney and credit-based indicators \nhave signalled a long phase of expansionary monetary policy.  Boom-bust cycles in the financial markets c\nannot form independently \nof monetary policy. \nAccording to empirical results, low long-term in\nterest rates tend to increase the risk appetite \nof financial market participants and thus contri\nbute to a dynamic worldwide growth in aggre-\ngate credit. Why is this the case? Two aspe\ncts should be mentioned here. First, low long-\nterm interest rates Œ which may \nindeed be justified from a m\nonetary policy perspective Œ are \nequivalent to low financing cost\ns in the financial markets and \ntherefore promote highly lev-\neraged business models. Second, in \nthe event that the target ra\nte of returns of financial", "Page 8 of 9  Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nmarket participants does not take into account that\n the level of the risk-free interest rate has \ndropped, a ﬁsearch for yieldﬂ process starts to \ntrigger an increase in risky business activities. \nThis process may come to an end very abruptly\n when market partic\nipants become aware of \ntheir high risk positions, for example, after \nmonetary policy puts an end to the phase of low \ninterest rates. Consequently, \na whole generation of business models will be brought into \nquestion. Moreover, low short-term rates have \nsupported business models that heavily re-\nlied on maturity mismatches. These models have \nrun into severe problems when short-term \nrates rose.  The influence of monetary policy on the behaviour\n of financial market participants might be \nespecially strong in the event t\nhat the central bank follows an\n asymmetric monetary policy \nthat is lowering rates aggressively in the fa\nce of macroeconomic downturns but increasing \nrates only gradually when downside risks have vani\nshed. Contrary to this approach, there is \nthe idea of a symmetrical monet\nary policy, which would not c\nonsider the boom-bust phases \nin the financial markets as isolated events, \nbut would try to look through the financial cycle \nand stabilise monetary policy. \nMoreover, a symmetrical monet\nary policy would consider a \nhigher key interest rate in t\nhe event of an increase in risk in\n the financial markets, even in \nthe absence of inflationary ri\nsk or macroeconomic risks within \nthe usual time horizon for \nmonetary policy. This does not\n mean that the central bank \nwould abandon its primary goal of price stability in favour of\n other intentions. The central bank\n would rather take a longer-\nterm perspective and include th\ne future consequences of unfavourable trends in the finan-\ncial markets in its analysis.   Without a doubt, a symmetrical monetary policy will\n not be able to eliminate future financial \ncrises. But I am convinced that a more sy\nmmetrical approach to m\nonetary policy will better alleviate the negative effects of the financia\nl cycle than a monetary policy approach that \nsolely tries to limit the damage \nin times of a financial downturn by aggressively lowering in-\nterest rates. This is even more the case wh\nen one assumes that the \nhigher moments of fi-\nnancial cycles are met exogenous to the monetary policy strategy\n chosen by central banks.", "Page 9 of 9  Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nIn this respect, the Eurosystem has a very val\nuable analytical tool for the medium to long-\nrun perspective: monetary analysis. This tool forc\nes us to extend the \nanalytical horizon be-\nyond the usual time span of two years and \nto include the low fr\nequency movements of monetary and credit aggregates in\n monetary analysis and the decision-making process. \nHence, the Eurosystem already has an import\nant stabilising element that enables us to \ncounteract procyclical trends in our monetary \ndecision-making. In future, this aspect of \nmonetary policy will need to\n gain in importance. 4 Conclusion With this request, I would like to close my s\npeech. In my view, the \nhighlighted issues are \ncrucial in the ongoing analysis and \nlearning process of the financia\nl crisis. I think it has be-\ncome clear that many promis\ning international initiatives have already been launched. How-ever, further effort is strongly needed in order\n to enhance transparency, market discipline \nand financial stability.  Obviously, financial regulation is currently being improved on in \nother aspects as well, in \nparticular as regards banking regul\nation. But getting into these \ndetails would surely go be-\nyond the scope of my speech.  Thank you very much for your attention. *    *    *"], "SECTION": "reden", "RECORD_ID": 744}
