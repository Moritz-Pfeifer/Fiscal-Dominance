Buch\n Vice President\n Deutsche \nBundesbank\n  Paris\n May 24, 2017\n  Resilience and digitalization are two key themes of the German G20 presidency. Digitalization, \nand in particular the provision of digital financial services\n, can contribute to enhanced financial \ninclusion. But risks also nee\nd to be managed appropriately, and financial knowledge is important\n to manage\n the\n risks and returns of financial services. The \nlevel\n of financial literacy tends to be \nlow, however, and financial illiteracy is a\nn issue that\n particular\nly affects\n the young. T\nhe young, in \nturn, are also the most vulnerable with regard to\n the\n long\n-term effects of mistakes in financial \ndecision making. Therefore, public policy in the form of financial education has an important role \n\nto play. Evidence on \nﬁwhat works\nﬂ in financial \neducation is \nsteadily\n accumulating, but sharing \ninformation on financial education programs and analyzing their effectiveness can significantly \n\nenhance our knowledge and contribute to better evidence\n-based policymaking. \n I. Priorities of the German G20 Presid\nency\n Financial crises cast long shadows. Almost ten years after the onset of the global financial \ncris\nis, \nits\n legacies continue to weigh on the world economy. Global growth is below its pre\n-crisis trends\n and\n debt levels remain high, though trends differ across regions and sectors. \nAt \nthe same time, the rapid digitalization of our economies requires \nthe\n markets, the financial \nsystem, and policymakers\n to adapt\n. Resilience and digitalization are, therefore, two \nkey priorities of the German G20 presidency\n.  Sustained resilience to shocks remains of key importance\n, for the private \nand\n for \nthe\n public \nsector. Financial regulatory reforms that enhance the stability of financial systems are one of \n\nthe main achievements\n of the post\n-crisis reform agenda. \nIn this regard\n, \nwe are gradually \nmoving from policy implementation to ex post impact assessment\ns. Impact assessments are \n                                                      1  I would like to thank Annamaria Lusardi\n, Karmela Holtgreve, \nFlore\n-Anne Messy, \nMoritz Schneemann\n, \nPanagiota Tzamourani\n and \nMartin Volkmar\n for\n their\n most helpful comments on an earlier draft. \nAll views \nexpressed in this paper are my own.", "2  needed to demonstrate the long\n-term benefits of the reforms. We need to look at the \neffectiveness of\n individual reforms, the interaction between reforms, and their aggregate \neffect\ns. The \nFinancial Stability Board (\nFSB) has started work on a structured framework for \npolicy evaluation. This evaluation will provide the basis for a structured assessment of w\nhat \nwe have achieved. It will also safeguard against the weakening of reforms and of resilience.\n Reaping the benefits of digitalization, in particular in the financial sector, is the second main \n\ntheme of the German G20 presidency. Technological innovations\n potentially contribute to \nresilience. Unleashing productivity \nmight strengthen\n the underlying growth dynamics, and \nthe allocation of risks can be improved. But these benefits do not materialize automatically. \n\nIt thus needs to be \nexplore\nd how innovative di\ngital financial services contribute to well\n-functioning financial markets. \nInnovations such as crowdfunding and distributed\n-ledger \ntechnologies are at the center of this debate. \nﬁFintechs\nﬂ can facilitate access to financial \nservices. These innovations can \nfoster competition, lower transaction costs, and improve risk \nsharing \nŒ thus promote innovation and growth in the real economy.\n But the risks of financial innovation must b\ne considered as well. Financial innovations might \nincrease systemic risk through effects on market structure, risk\n-taking incentives, or \npro\n-cyclicality\n and common exposures to shocks. Also, the threat of cyber attacks requires very \nclose attention and\n, pos\nsibl\ny, regulatory intervention.\n One aspect of this debate is the contribution of financial innovation to financial inclusion. \n\nFinancial inclusion \ncan\n promote economic prosperity and help strengthen opportunities\n for \nSMEs and individuals\n. Yet it requires co\nnsumers and investors to acquire additional skills and \nabilities. Wide\n-spread access to financial markets and a greater variety of products on offer \nincrease the likelihood of financial fraud. A certain level of financial literacy to properly \n\nmanage risks \nis therefore required. Financial inclusion and financial literacy are thus two key \n\nthemes of the German G20 presidency\n™s priority ﬁshaping digitalizationﬂ\n. In \nthe following\n, I would like to discuss the importance of financial literacy, and in particular \nfinancial education, focusing on three key questions:\n  Why is financial literacy important for individuals, society, and central banks?\n  What drives financial literacy and, more specifically, what is the role of financial \n\neducation?\n  What are\n the\n implications for policymakers? How can we learn from best practice \nand evaluate policies that aim at promoting financial literacy?\n I will begin \nby \noutlining the key fact\ns on financial literacy.", "3  II. Financial Literacy \nŒ the Key Facts\n Financial literacy \ndenotes \nthe appropriate skills and knowledge that enable individuals to \nmake sound financial decisions. \n A related concept is financial capability which includes \neconomic behaviour, such as managing day\n-to day\n spending\n well, looking ahead and \nplanning unan\nticipated expenditures, selecting and using available products appropriately. \nThe\n OECD \ndefines financial literacy as \na combination of awareness, knowledge, skill, attitude\n, and \nbehaviour\n necessary to make sound financial decision\ns and ultimately achieve in\ndividual \nfinancial wellbeing\n (OECD/INFE 2011\n: 3). Measures of \nfinancial \nliteracy\n have\n not \nbeen \navailable in national surveys, but have been \nadded recently\n. For example, \nAnna\nmaria Lusardi and Olivia Mitchell\n (2011\na) developed \nthree \nsimple questions\n to measur\ne the knowledge of fundamental concepts\n at the basis of \nfinancial decision\n-making. The\n following\n questions have been added to national surveys in \nmore than \n15 countries\n:2  (1)\n Suppose you had 100 euro(/$) in a savings account and the interest rate was 2%\n per year. After 5 years, how much do you think you would have in the account if\n you left the money to grow:  More than 102 euro, exactly 102 euro, less than\n 102 euro?\n (2)\n Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1% per year and \n\ninflation was\n 2% per year. After 1 year, would you be able to buy more than, \nexactly the same as, or less than today with the money in this account?\n (3)\n Do you think that the following statement is true or false? ﬁBuying a single \n\ncompany stock usually provides a safer \nreturn than a stock mutual fundﬂ.\n  In the year 201\n4, \na global survey on financial \nknowledge \nwas\n carried out in more than 140 \ncountries\n (Klapper, Lusardi, and van Oudheusden 2015)\n. Based on \na toolkit developed by the \nOECD and the International Network for F\ninancial Education (\nINFE\n), in 2015 \n30 countries \ncarried out financial literacy surveys.\n These and other \nnational and international studies \nshowed\n that the level of financial literacy \ntends to be\n low.\n3 Combining the scores on \nfinancial \nknowledge, \nbehaviour\n and attitude\ns, the average score across all participating \ncountries\n in the OECD/INFE survey\n is 13.2 out of a possible 21 \n(Figure 1)\n.                                                        2  These \nquestions are\n also included in the German household \nwealth \nsurvey, the Panel on Household \nFinances (PHF), carried out by the Deutsche Bundesbank. Summary \nresults are presented in the Appendix.\n In all three questions, there are two additional options respondents can choose, such as ﬁI do not know,ﬂ \nand ﬁI refuse to answerﬂ\n. 3  The \n2015\n international survey \nfor 30 countries \nﬁInternational survey of adult fina\nncial literacy \ncompetenciesﬂ was published by the OECD/ International Network on Financial Education (INFE) \nin October\n 2016.", "4  Breaking down the overall score yields some interesting \nfacts\n:  As regards \nfinancial knowledge\n, on average, 56% of adults \nachieved a score of at \nleast five out of seven\n, which is \nconsidered to be the minimum target score\n (Figure \n2). Only 42% of adults are aware of the additional benefits of \ncompound \ninterest on \nsavings.\n Only two in three adults\n are aware that it is possible t\no reduce investment \nrisk by buying a range of different stocks.\n   With respect to\n financial \nbehaviour\n, one in two (51%) respondents achieved the \nminimum target score of at least six out of nine.\n The weakest areas of financial \nbehaviour\n across these measures \nare \nrelated to budgeting, planning ahead, choosing \nproducts\n, and using independent advice.\n  Financial \nattitudes\n show a tendency towards \nshort\n-termism\n. Respondents tend to \nfavour ﬁliving for todayﬂ and spending money rather than \nsettin\ng financial goal\ns and \nplanning for the future\n. On average, 50% of adults achieved the minimum target \nscore for financial attitude\n, which is deemed positive if it shows a\n tend\nency to favour \nsaving and financial planning\n.  There are \ngender differences\n in financial knowledge: 61% of men achieve the \nminimum target score, compared with only 51% of women\n (Figure 3)\n. This ﬁgender \ngapﬂ is fairly persistent across countries\n.   Young people\n display a low level of financial knowledge. This is the case even in \ncountries with high income per capita or well developed financial markets. The \nevidence from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA)\n financial \nliteracy option\n documents that\n, in most countries\n participating in the exercises in \n2012 and 2015\n, a sizable\n fraction of \nsecondary\n school students are not at all \nproficient in financial literacy\n (OECD\n, 2017)\n.4  The latter finding is particularly important in the context of work on financial literacy among \n\nthe young, including the importance of financial\n education and training.\n Financial decision\ns taken early on in li\nfe can have a significant impact on future well\n-being, wealth, and income. \nHence, the importance of financial literacy is an issue I turn\n to next.\n                                                       4  Germany has not participated in the most recent financial literacy survey included in PISA.", "5  III. Why is Financial Literacy Important?\n Financial literacy is of key importance for \nindividuals, for societies, and for central banks.\n For \nindividuals\n, decisions on the level and structure of savings can have significant impacts \non future income. \nHouseholds \nroutinely\n take decisions which \naffect \ntheir \nexpos\nure\n to future \nshocks by saving too little, investing sub\n-optimally, or by borrowing too much.\n  Akerlof and Shiller (2009: p. 117) illustrate the power of compound interest\n and the \nimportance of decision\n-making at the individual level\n. They describe a policy by Harvard \nUniversity to pay interest to assistant professors™ retirement accounts \nafter\n the recipients \nhad signed a declaration of where the money would be invested. \nA senior fa\nculty member \nadvised assistance professors to make th\nis statement soon\n in order\n not to forego compound \ninterest on the accounts. \nFollow\ning\n this advice\n would\n generat\ne a substantial\n increase in \nwealth.\n More generally, t\nhe gains from financial literacy \nŒ or losses \nresulting from a \nlack of \nfinancial \nliteracy\n Œ have been documented in several studies\n, which are comprehensively reviewed in \nLusardi and Mitchell\n (2014).\n Decisions on\n debt and\n debt management are important\n, but \nindividuals often do not display savvy \nbehaviour\n. Cam\npbell (2006)\n studies the decisions of \nhouseholds to refinance. Refinancing \nmight\n be optimal if interest rates decline. Yet \nmany US \nhouseholds fail to refinance even\n if savings \nwould have been substantial \nin terms of interest \nexpenses\n. Less wealthy\n and less educated households were more likely to make mistakes \nthan wealthier and better educated households.\n Besides being less likely to make mistakes, \nthose with higher\n numeracy or\n financial literacy\n are more likely to \nparticipate in financial \nmarkets \nand invest in stocks (Christelis, Jappelli and Padula, 2010\n; van Rooij, Lusardi and \nAlessie (2011\n), \nto \nhold precautionary savings (de Bassa Scheresberg 2013)\n, or \nto \nundertake \nretirement planning (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011a, 2011\nb). Differences in financia\nl literacy across individuals can thus be a relevant\n factor behind \ndifferences in wealth across individuals\n. Lusardi, Michaud\n, and Mitchell (2017) estimate that \n30-40 \n% of \nthe inequality in \nretirement wealth in the US is accounted for by \ndifferences in \nfinancial literacy\n.  Given the link between financial literacy and wealth accumulation, age obviously matters. \nThe link between age and financial performance is explicitly picked up in \nAgarwal, Driscoll, \n\nGabaix and Laibson (20\n09). They \ndocument that \nfinanc\nial performance exhibits an inverse U\n-shape pattern\n, with performance peaking in middle age.\n In other words, f\ninancial mistakes \nare more likely to occur among the younger and \nthe \nolder population\n. The authors\n examine  \ndifferent\n financial transactions \nsuch \nas \ncredit card balance transfer offers,\n mis-estimation\n of", "6  the value of one™s house, and\n excess interest rate and fee payments.\n They\n observe that \nyounger and older consumers tend to\n pay\n higher fees and interest rates on their loans. \nResults seem to be drive\nn by a trade\n-off between experience and fluid intelligence: \nRelatively young borrowers tend to have low levels of experience (ﬁcrystallized intelligenceﬂ) \n\nbut a high degree of fluid intelligence\n. Older borrowers tend to have high levels of \ncrystallized int\nelligence \nbut\n relatively lower \nlevels of ﬁ\nfluid intelligence\nﬂ in terms of\n performance on novel ta\nsks.  Financial literacy also matters \nfor \nsociety\n as a whole\n. Voters and policymakers have to \ndecide on the level of public debt, the amount of borrowing, and \nthe level of pensions. All \nthese decisions are likely to be distorted if they are based on incomplete knowledge of key \n\nfinancial accounting concepts.\n  Citizens are the indirect drivers of the political process because politicians are elected based \non the v\noters™ assessment of political programs (Fornero 2014). \nEconomic and financial \nliteracy \nare thus important when it comes to \npolitical decisions taken \non issues such as\n pension reforms. Financial literacy helps citizens clarify the features, options, and co\nsts of \npension systems, and to assess the notion of acquired rights. This enhance\ns understanding \nof the necessity of reforms in countries where pension systems prove unsustainable and \nwhere reforms have to be undertaken. \n A related issue is analyzed i\nn a l\naboratory experiment\n by \nFochmann, Sachs, Sadrieh, and \nWeimann (2016)\n, who \nanalyze intergenera\ntiona\nl borrowing decisions. They show that, \nwithin a generation, debt is accumulated prudently. As soon as they allow for \n\nintergenerational dynamics, participants \nborrow too much and burden successive \ngenerations with high levels of debt. \nThis experiment does not explicitly analyze the role of \nfinancial literacy\n. Its external validity \nŒ as with\n any other experimental setting \nŒ might be \nlimited\n. But \nresults \nshow the\n importance of individual \nand \ncollective\n decision\n-making for \npublic debt dynamics\n.  Related evidence is \nprovided by\n Heinemann, Janeba, Schröder, and Streif (2016) \nwho \nlook at \npublic debt dynamics by analyzing the link between fiscal rules and deficit expect\nations of \n\npolicy\n-makers in Germany. They analyze a survey of members of\n the\n 16 German state \nparliaments. The\nir survey reveals limited credibility of the debt \nbrakes\n and an asymmetry \nin expectations on compliance between insiders and outsiders (in\n-state ver\nsus out\n-of-state \npoliticians, incumbent government vs. opposition). They attribute this to overconfidence of \n\nthe incumbents.\n Moreover\n, financial literacy seems to have an impact on the occupational decisions of \nindividuals which, in turn, may affect struct\nural change and productivity growth. Focusing on", "7  individual decisions, Cumurovic and Hyll (2017) use German data and find that financial \n\nliteracy positively affects the probability of being self\n-employed.\n Finally, \ncentral banks\n routinely communicate their \npolicies by referring to concepts such as \ninflation and \ninterest rates\n. Interest in the drivers and effects of financial literacy have \narguably become even more\n important for central banks in recent years\n, as central banks \nhave been \nmandated\n with ensur\ning\n a higher degree of \nfinancial stability\n. Financial stability is \nintrinsically linked to the quality of financial decision\n-making in an economy. Funding \nor \ninvestment \ndecisions that ignore fundamental values\n and\n are based on erroneous \nassessments of future \nprice and interest rate developments\n, can put the stability of the \nentire financial system at risk. While macroprudential policy measures are the ultimate \n\nbackstop mechanisms, financial stability starts at the individual level and with informed \n\nfinancial d\necision\n-making.\n Financial stability risks emerging from housing markets\n are a case in point\n. More than two\n-thirds of all Europeans own the homes they live in\n, and residential property typically forms \nthe largest component of their wealth.\n5  The majority of\n households borrow to finance a \nhome purchase. Once they are homeowners, in many countries they can use their \nproperty\n as collateral to access funding (Skudelny 2009, Sousa 2009). \nMortgage debt is \nthus \nthe main \nfinancial liability of the household sector i\nn advanced economies.\n6 Also,\n mortgage loans are \na major asset of the financial system,  particular\nly for\nbanks.\n7 Movements in house prices \ncan \nthus have a significant impact on the financial positions of banks and households\n. A surge in \nhouse prices\n, coupled with a strong expansion in mortgage loans and an easing of credit \nstandards\n, may also pose risks to the stability of the financial system as a whole.\n8 In fact, \nduring a house price boom, market participants may form overly positive expectations \n\nregarding future developments in debt sustainability. They may largely disregard the \npossibility that asset prices may fall and interest rates may rise. If house prices fall and \ndefault rates increase, banks may not be able to offset the resulting losses fro\nm mortgage \nlending.\n                                                       5  In Germany, \nrates of \nhomeownership are somewhat lower. In 2015, \nslightly\n more than 50\n% of households \nowned the houses they lived in (Eurostat 2017).\n 6  Mortgage debt amounts\n, on average\n, to about two\n-thirds of household liabilities in Euro \nArea countries. In \nGermany, mortgages \naccount\ned for about 70% of total household debt in 2016. See OECD Households™ \nFinancial Assets and Liabilities, http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=QASA_7HH.\n 7  In Germany, for example, roughly 51% of all outstanding bank loans to domestic enterpr\nises and \nhouseholds were housing loans in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n 8  Several empirical contributions show that the damage done to the economy by the bursting of credit\n-driven \nreal estate price booms is significant and long\n-lasting, e.g. Brunnermeier an\nd Schnabel (2015) as well as \nTaylor (2015).", "8  Policy measures aimed at safeguarding against financial stability risks arising from the \n\nmortgage markets are thus geared towards maintaining debt sustainability for households \n\nand mitigating losses due to financial distress. For this p\nurpose, minimum requirements can \nbe defined with regard to debt levels relative to the income of households, the debt service \n\nrelative to income, loan\n-to-value ratios, and amortization requirements. All of these \nmeasures may have a disproportionate effect \non younger households with lower wealth and \nincome than for older households. Hence, communicating the benefits of these measures for \n\nsociety as a whole while being aware of the distributional consequences is a key challenge \n\nfor policymakers.\n9 Such communi\ncation benefits significantly from heightened financial \nknowledge in a society.\n IV.\n What Drives Financial Literacy?\n Given the importance of financial literacy over the li\nfe cycle of individuals, for society, and \nfor central banks, are there any specific polici\nes that can be used to enhance financial \n\nliteracy? \nThe \nlevel\n of financial literacy of an individual is closely related to individual \ncharacteristics such as the level of education, income,\n gender and age\n. Also, country \ncharacteristics \ncan\n play an important\n role. In countries with a \ndefined\n-contribution \npension \nsystem, for instance, individual savings decisions are much more important than in countries \n\nwith a pay\n-as-you\n-go system. \nThis limits the ability of politicians to change the level of \nfinancial literacy, \nparticularly\n in the short\n-run. \nJohn Campbell (2016\n: 20) thus argue\ns that \nﬁconsumer financial \nilliteracy is a sufficiently serious problem, and hard enough to cure \nthrough fin\nancial education and disclosures\n, [such]\n that some degree of financial regulation \ncan be justified even if it imposes costs on rational households\nﬂ. While the benefits of better financial literacy first and foremost accrue to the individual, \n\nsociety as a w\nhole also has an interest in better financial decision\n-making. This raises the \nissue \nof the role of \npublic policy\n in improving financial literacy\n levels\n. Statements about the \neffectiveness of interventions, however, are plagued by a key identification prob\nlem: If \n\nindividuals are more financially literate after \nattending\n an educational program, is this the \neffect of the program itself? Or might there be selection effects or effects of other, \n\nunobservable characteristics\n that drive the results\n? In a recent st\nudy, Kaiser and Menkoff (\n2016\n) perform a meta\n-analysis of studies on the \neffects of financial education programs.\n The study is based on 115 microeconometric impact \nevaluation studies\n (out of a total of 500 studies available)\n, including randomized controlled \n                                                      9  See CGGS Committee on the Global Financial System (2016) for a review of the communication of \nmacroprudential measures.", "9  trials.\n10\n Their main\n finding is that financial education \nand financial literacy \nimpact financial \nbehaviour\n. At the same time, results are very heterogeneous across studies\n. The \nway \nin \nwhich \nfinancial education is implemente\nd matters\n. According to the results, e\nffects of \nfinancial education depend on \n–  – the \ntarget group\n: Teaching low\n-income \nparticipants\n (relative to country mean\ns) has \na weaker\n impact, especially in low and lower\n-middle income \ncountries\n.  – the \ntype of financial \nactivity\n target\ned: Behaviour\n, for example related to borrowing \ndecisions, is difficult to influence.\n  – the \ntime\n financial education is received\n: Providing financial education at a \nﬁteachable momentﬂ, i.e. when teaching is directly linked \nto decision\ns of immediate \nrelevance to the target group\n, the best results\n are achieved\n.  – the country™s \nlevel of economic development\n and quality of the \neducational \nsystem\n: Interventions in low\n-income \ncountries\n appear to be less successful than \nthose \nin \nhigh\n-income countries.\n  The study also shows that some factors which one might consider to be important are \n\nactually not relevant for the effects of financial education. These factors are age, gender, or \n\nthe specific channel of interventions.\n Note that im\nproving the measurement of financial literacy \ncan contribute to a better \ndesign \nand evaluation \nof policies.\n Answers to the \ntypical financial literacy \nquestions are subject to \nmeasurement error. The wording, for example, of the questions matters\n. This \nindic\nates that \nrespondents may sometimes be guessing the answer\n. For example,\n respondents are more \nlikely to get the answer right to the investment diversification question when it is structured \n\nso that the correct answer is \nﬁTrue\nﬂ (Lusardi and Mitchell 2009).\n Another issue that needs to \nbe taken into account is that non\n-responses might differ systematically across respondents. \nRecent surveys address these issues, so that better evidence will accumulate over time.\n V.\n Implications for Policymakers\n Adequate financial\n knowledge is important. It is particularly important for the young. \nFinancial decisions taken at\n a younger age affect income and wealth over the lifetime and \nyoung cohort\ns have important stakes in policy decisions related to fiscal policy and pension \nrefo\nrms. At the same time, financial knowledge among the young is limited, as\n is shown by \n                                                      10  Laboratory experiments can help addressing the identification issue but \nmay have limi\nted \nexternal validity. \nWinter, Lührmann and Garcia (2013)\n, for example,\n conducted an \nexperimental study in German high\n-schools that teenagers show low interest in financial matters, but financial education increase\ns their \ninterest.", "10  recent evidence from the PISA survey \n(OECD, \n2017)\n. Designing and implementing effective \nfinancial education programs is challenging.\n What can policymakers take away from \nthe \nlarge and accumulating set of evidence on financial literacy?\n  Financial literacy \nŒ like any other \neducational achievement\n Œ is grounded in individual \ncapabilities\n. Given the importance of \ngood \nand informed financial decision\n-making for \nsocieties as a \nwhole, there is scope for public financial education.\n But how to design financial \neducation programs such that they are effective? And how to reach parts of the population \n\nwhich do not voluntar\nily participate in \neducational programs\n? The study by Kaiser an\nd Menkoff (2016) suggests that programs\n that are well implemented deliver promising results\n.  Educational programs\n have to account for the specificities of national educational systems\n. Successful approaches will differ across countries, given the heteroge\nneity of educational \nsystems and \nother \ninstitution\nal features\n affecting financial literacy.\n At the same time, \nnational policymakers are likely to benefit from drawing lessons across countries.\n While\n an \nincreasing number of financial literacy programs \nare being evaluated\n and are subject to \ncosts\n-benefit analysis\n, \nmany \ninitiatives \nare not. E\nvidence on their effectiveness is\n, therefore\n, lacking.\n The OECD/\nInternational Network on Financial Education \n(INFE\n) is currently working on \ncreating an international database of evaluation studies related to financial literacy.\n The \ndatabase will also allow policy\n-makers, researchers\n, and practitioners to identify good \npractice.\n The database is expected to cover all typ\nes of financial education initiatives, from \nmore traditional classroom\n-based training and printed material to broad awareness \ncampaigns, events and innovative channels, including online educational games, interactive \n\ntools, and \nfilm material\n. Moreover, the\n envisaged database would contain information on \nselected indicators of program effectiveness\n (financial\n-education.org)\n. The German\n G20\n presidency\n is contributing to\n better\n analys\ne, share\n and \ndesign\n financial \nliteracy programs. \nTherefore it supports the \nimplement\nation of\n the \nﬂHigh Level Principles of \nDigital Financial Inclusionﬁ\n which had been endorsed at\n the 2016 G20 Hangzhou summit\n. The\n G20\n countries\n agreed to participate\n in the\n OECD/INFE \nfinancial literacy survey and\n were\n encourag\ned to publish\n results to establish a comparable database \nto facilitate\n evaluating \nfinancial literacy program\ns. The results \nof the survey \nwill be shared in a report on ﬁAdult \nFinancial Literacy Competencies in G20 Countriesﬂ around the summit in Hamburg in July\n 2017.  Further, a second report from G20/OECD INFE called ﬁEnsuring\n financial education and \nconsumer\n protection for all in the digital age\nﬂ was presented at the FM/CBG Meeting in \nWashington\n, D.C.\n on \nthe margin\ns of the IMF Spring Meetings\n 2017\n.
