It is also a significant requirement for financial stability analysis.  \n However, emerging market economies and develop\ning countries have significant gaps in \ntheir local bond market data. Against this backdrop, G8 finance ministers recommended in their action plan adopted in May 2007 Œ inter alia - a broadening of the database and \n\ncollective international effo\nrts ﬁto identify any gapsﬂ.  \n The conference on ﬁBond Markets in Emerging Market Economies and Developing \nCountries Œ Financial Globalisation, Vulnerabilities and Data Needsﬂ, which was organised \nby the Bundesbank in cooperation with the Federal Ministry of Finance, is making a \ncontribution towards implementing this recommendation, as is also stated in the implementation report.  \n  The main focus of this conference was on the following aspects:   (1) What main financial stability questions - at\n present and in the near future - cannot be answered owing to a lack of data? (2) What data sources are currently available for this purpose?", "Page 3 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nSignificant trends in the international financial markets \n To answer these questions, it is important to include the lessons learned from past and \npresent financial developments and to assess their relevance for new data requirements. In this context, particular attention should be paid to\n four significant trends\n in the international \nfinancial system.   First, financial globalisation is a process which is leading to changes in market structures. Adequately recording these changes in the mark\net structures Œ new investor groups, new instruments, changes in the maturities etc Œ and its implications for financial stability is a key task, especially with regard to emerging market economies and developing countries.  \n The second important trend is the institutionalisation of saving. In the quest for yields and risk diversification, large internationally operating \ninvestors are taking growing account of emerging market economies and developing countries in their portfolio decisions.   The third trend which is closely related to this is the \nmarketisation of finance\n. This entails not only a greater exploitation of international financial markets through the extended reach of \ninstitutional investors and hedge funds. The marketisation of finance also involves a greater \ntransfer of risks from bank balance sheets and t\nheir bundling in new marketable instruments \n(securitisation).   The fourth trend is that, in some countries, risks are being increasingly shifted to the household and corporate sectors.   Against this backdrop, the philosophy of the conference in Frankfurt was to promote a wide-ranging discussion between the users and producers \nof statistics, starting by focusing on the requirements from a financial stability perspective.", "Page 4 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n  Identification of data requirements - dimensions of the problem \n The discussion regarding data requirements can probably be best summarised by focusing \non the following aspects, which could also be conducive to achieving the envisaged \n\nobjectives of the next stages with regard to identifying and closing data gaps.  \n From a more static perspective, it should first be ascertained how, for instance, the statistical coverage of the bond markets in the EMEs and the developing countries \ncompares to that of industrial countries. There is a need to enhance the transparency of available data and data quality.    The second dimension of the identification of data problems must be considered from a \nmore dynamic perspective. In particular, the process of financial globalisation can quickly \nlead to a rapid change in market players and instruments and, in turn, to significant changes in the risk exposures of these countries. A pr\neventive stability policy which aims to avert \nfinancial market crises must focus to a greater extent than in the past on analysing possible new vulnerabilities while simultaneously conducting a critical review of the new data requirements arising as a result.   Experience has taught us that a crisis seldom has\n the same causes as previous tensions in the financial markets. Furthermore, such a forward-looking debate would also help to \nshorten the time lag between the emergence of new data gaps and the plugging of these \n\ngaps.   The third dimension of the data problem is the increasing significance of international or internationally comparable statistics\n. The related requirements and need for statistical data", "Page 5 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nwhich are quickly available are growing. In view of the burgeoning \nimportance of emerging market economies, this also applies, in particular, to their financial markets. \n  The fourth dimension in terms of identifying data \nrequirements is the increasing importance of microstructural data\n. While it is possible to assess the development of currency and maturity mismatches using raw macroeconomic data, it is necessary to analyse and observe the currency and maturity mismatches below the macroeconomic averages across individual sectors or households and enter\nprises. Balance sheet approaches and micro-level data \nbecoming increasingly important.  \n  Key objectives    The main trends and dimensions of the problem can provide assistance when prioritising \nfurther steps to fill data gaps. Discussions \non this matter during the conference have \nhighlighted the following key areas of action.    Implementation of the CGFS working group™s findings \n The CGFS working group on financial stabi\nlity and local currency bond markets and a related subgroup have made significant contributions to identifying data needs, particularly \nin terms of better coverage of data with regard to the market structure. These recommendations comprise improvements of BIS securities statistics by better breakdown of currency issue, sector of issue, maturity, instrument, meas\nures of issuance at residual etc. The incorporation of this agenda is part of the work programme of the working group on securities databases.", "Page 6 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nCompiling internationally\n comparable statistics \n The creation of a harmonised international framework for collecting and compiling data is \ncentral to the objective of filling gaps in \ndata on local bond markets in emerging market \neconomies and developing countries. In her pres\nentation entitled ﬁSecurities Markets and External Debt: US Perspectives on Data Availabilityﬂ, Carol Bertaut (FED) emphasised the fact that this particularly conc\nerns the comparability of data on debt securities, cross-border securities and external debt measures. Data stemming from different sources show distinct differences, in particular for emerging market economies. From this, she rightly identifies a \n\nﬁclear need for comparable definitions and comprehensive measurements of debt securities and external debtﬂ.   Here, the IMF and, in particular, BIS are called upon to create a uniform methodological framework. Paul van den Bergh™s work seeking to lay the foundations for such a framework for creating an internationally comparable database appears to be \nparticularly suitable for shedding light on the different ways in which data have been collected to date. The BIS \ninitiative to draft a compilation guide via the \nworking group on securities databases is among \nthose tasks relating to the broadening of the database which should be given high priority.    Intensifying the dialogue between users and producers of statistics about future data \nrequirements \n In his presentation on ﬁStatistics for the Balance Sheet Approachﬂ, Alfredo Leone (IMF) outlined the main future challenges. The most important appear to be ﬁinnovative and \ncomplex financial instruments, including an increased securitisation of banks™ balance sheets and the use of instruments of credit risk transferﬂ, the ﬁsignificant expansion of cross-border financial linkages; extension of financial intermediaries™ inte\nrnational operations", "Page 7 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nthrough cross-border provision of servicesﬂ and the ﬁrapid growth of cross-border portfolio investments and the stock of international assets and liabilitiesﬂ. These requirements apply \nnot just to bond markets in industrialised count\nries, but increasingly to emerging market \neconomies, too.  \n In her presentation on ﬁFinancial Globalisation and Emerging Bond Marketsﬂ, Ceyla Pazarbasioglu drew attention to the speed at which structural changes are currently taking place on bond markets in emerging market economies and also in some developing countries. We would like to emphasize Alfredo Leone™s conclusi\non that ﬁfurther improvements in financial statistics are needed for them to remain relevant for critical policy and analytical work in understanding the phenomenon and its impacts, and potential risks \nand vulnerabilities that might ariseﬂ in \nparticular with a view to the increasing internationalisation of financial markets, the arrival of new investors and the rapid spread of \nfinancial innovations. There is a need for ongoing and institutionalised discussion about \nchanging risk exposures as a result of c\nhanging bond market structures and financial innovations and resulting data needs.  \n With this in mind, the proposal to set up a future financial crises working group within the IMF to analyse countries™ susceptibility to potential financial crises in greater detail is to be welcomed. We believe that there is a need for intensified international collaboration in this area, focusing on the data requirements arising from crises and financial innovations. The BIS and the central banks should specifically be involved in this project. Central banks, in \nparticular, should participate in these discussions \nbecause, if a liquidity crisis were to arise, \nthen they would form the main ﬁline of defenceﬂ and play a key role in data collection.", "Page 8 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nGiving greater consideration to central financial stability issues when identifying data gaps  An array of core issues which are left unanswered owing to a lack of data come to light in stability reviews and other reports of international institutions\n. It is therefore likely that studies which, for example, focus in many different ways on the implications of a greater integration of emerging market economies in the financial globalisation process will become \nmore important. Consequently, important aspects :     The international integration of market\ns is leading to changes not only in the transmission channels through which contagion effects are routed but also in the width of these transmission channels. The consequences of the subprime crisis in \nparticular have demonstrated the extent to which tension in one international financial \nmarket segment can spill over to financial markets in other global regions.    Financial markets are exerting a growing \ninfluence on a country™s fundamentals even though their development is itself not always geared to these fundamentals. The associated implications are becoming more critical for the assessment of financial stability. This means, for example, that the po\nrtfolio strategies of internationally active \nfunds are having an increasing impac\nt on financial globalisation.  \n  Data for analysing the investment behaviour of\n international investors becoming more \nsignificant \n Potential contagions resulting from the invest\nment behaviour of global players are becoming \nan increasingly significant issue.

The studies also show that the \nreactions of major institutional investors to\n exogenous shocks are a key determinant of the \ndevelopment and spread of financial crises. In contrast to the growing importance of these \nstudies for analysing financial stability, many \ndata can only be obtained through surveys, as with the information on institutional investors obtained through the CGFS study. Deepening the database and improving the quality of existing data are two top priorities in this field.   Frank Warnock et al. underlined that we know very little about foreign investor participation in local bond markets. The data quality of the Coordinated Por\ntfolio Investment Survey of \nthe IMF has to be improved. ﬁCPIS data provides no information on currency denomination, which is vital for bonds.ﬂ Despite the increasing \nimportance of portfolio flows to local bond \n\nmarkets, ﬁother than anecdotes, we know little about portfolio behaviourﬂ (Warnock). This is all the more important since institutional investors are key drivers for a more efficient allocation of credit and capital. They also co\nntribute to creating new channels for financial spillovers. ﬁThese are unavoidable, but we need to understand them better.ﬂ (Marianne Schulze-Ghattas) Therefore, collecting dat\na on bond holders and enhancing the quality of \ncross-border positions and related flows to\n emerging market economies and developing countries are two top priorities.    Creation of a harmonised international data platfo\nrm Œ is the Globalised Securities Database \n\n(GSDB) a realistic option?   Some of the above-mentioned challenges can \nbe met by setting up securities databases. Whether the Centralised Securities Database \n(CSDB), currently being developed by the \nEuropean Central Bank in close cooperation with the national central banks, can form a \nnucleus for a Globalised Securities Database \nremains to be seen. As Werner Bier and", "Page 10 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nStefan Brunken illustrated, the CSDB will offer participating countries a broad pool of data, \nwhich can be flexibly used for different analytical purposes.   The principal advantages of the CSDB, as highlighted by Werner Bier\n and Stefan Brunken, include the fact that the CSDB ﬁallows the compilation of very detailed statistics for a high \nnumber of security and issuer features, user needs can be met on a flexible basis –, there is a short 'time-to-market'; and security and issuer classifications are now under the control \n\nof statistical expertsﬂ.  \n The database can be flexibly adapted to suit developments on the financial markets. \nComparatively little outlay is \ntherefore required to perform various statistical analyses based \non the database. Further discussions will show the extent to which this also applies to \nfinancial stability issues arising in this connection.  Whether or not a Globalised Securities Dat\nabase is a realistic option for covering data needs also depends on the amount of time and costs required to develop such a system \n\nand get it up and running.      Further extension of balance sheet approaches  Extensive databases have been set up by various \nbodies as part of their current research activities on local bond markets in emerging \nmarket economies. Many of these are devoted to balance sheet approaches.", "Page 11 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nEconomies™ susceptibility to exogenous disrupt\nions emanating from the financial markets can only be estimated using aggregated macr\noeconomic indicators. This problem is \ncompounded by the fact that new crises in recent years have originated more and more in \nindividual sectors. Balance sheet approaches\n are especially helpful in revealing intersectoral \nlinkages and thus the transmission channels of di\nsruptions. In particular, they facilitate a better assessment of risks and the extent to whic\nh financial market crises will impact on the real economy.   In the context of balance sheet analysis,\n Alfredo Leone™s research highlighted two points. First, the available data are di\nstributed very unevenly across the individual sectors on an \ninternational average. Data in the financial se\nctor are far more reliable. Second, a much greater degree of coverage is required regarding balance sheet\n data of enterprises and households to be able to analyse the balanc\ne sheet effects and data needs mentioned. However, such data are in short supply in \nthe industrialised countries and as good as non-\nexistent in emerging market economies.    Developing local currency bond markets are beneficial for reducing currency mismatches. ﬁBut we need better data to analyze which vulnerabilities remain, or are perhaps increasing \nŒ especially for the private sect\nor.ﬂ (Marianne Schulze-Ghattas)  \n Some multilateral development banks have \nworked closely with economic research institutions and invested a great deal of time and effort in setting up databases to analyse \nvulnerabilities in precisely this area. In doi\nng so, they have concentrated on evaluating a \nlarge number of corporate balance sheets. In\n many cases, however, these were only prepared for the purpose of specific evaluations and have not been updated. This therefore \n\nraises the question of the extent to which these data can be integrated in the work of the International Monetary Fund and whether internationally comparable databases can be set \nup in this field.", "Page 12 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n The discussion has shown that there is still a \nsubstantial need for comparable data in this area. These data are especially important given that cu\nrrency and maturity mismatches seem to be developing in the corporate sector in particular, yet data on this are considerably \nharder to come by there. There would therefore appear to be scope to coordinate the \ninitiatives of the Internati\nonal Monetary Fund, World Bank and multilateral development banks in this field.    In conclusion, as well as weaker data coverage of local bond markets in emerging market \n\neconomies and developing countries\n, there are also data gaps in those fields in which \ndeeper analysis of financial stability issues is necessary.        *    *    *"], "SECTION": "reden", "RECORD_ID": 790}
