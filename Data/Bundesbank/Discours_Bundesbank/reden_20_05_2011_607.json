The \nimportance we attach to research is also u\nnderlined by the fact that\n this conference has \nbeen hosted by two central banks, and I would li\nke to thank the Banque de France for the \nexcellent cooperation and for making this event possible. The topic of this conference ﬁFiscal and Mone\ntary Policy Challenges\n in the Short and Long \nRunﬂ is an evergreen. But this time it was \nparticularly well chosen: the recent crisis has \nbrought monetary and fiscal policy to\n the centre of attention. \nIt has become apparent that \nthey can be important instruments to contain \na crisis. However, we have also seen that \nfiscal and monetary policy may be at least partly responsible for the emergence of a crisis.", "Page 3 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany\n www.bundesbank.de \n E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nSpeaking in general terms, both fields of po\nlicy are faced with complex problems. The \neffects of the various measures are uncertain; \nand as the title of this conference correctly \nemphasises, it is important to ta\nke into account the short term but at the same time essential \nnot to lose sight of long-term \neffects. Stabilisation is\n of particular concern during a crisis, yet \nallocation and the preservation of\n appropriate incentives in a ma\nrket economy are crucial. It \nmight be necessary to bear costs now to prev\nent even higher costs fr\nom emerging in the \nfuture. Hence, when evaluatin\ng policy measures we have to make a clear distinction \nbetween the actual crisis and its aftermath. The financial crisis was caused by a cocktail of\n shortcomings in different areas, such as \nregulatory loopholes, monetary \nand fiscal policy mistakes, macroeconomic imbalances and \ninsufficient risk management practices in systemic \nfinancial institutions in an environment of \ndynamic financial innovations. Thus, I would be \nvery sceptical regarding overly simplistic \nexplanations for the crisis. But all these defici\nencies led to exaggerations in different sectors \nand countries. When these exag\ngerations suddenly reversed themselves, the crisis \nemerged and affected the world economy in a wa\ny not observed in post-war years. During \nthe crisis, fiscal and monetary policy both played a decisive role in stabilising the financial \nmarkets and the real economy. The \nchallenge now is to turn back to normal mode. This is a \nparticularly demanding task in a volatile \nand erratic environment. However, overdoing \nexpansionary policies will rat\nher start a new and probably ev\nen worse crisis instead of \nbringing the current crisis to an end. Thus, it is imperative to lear\nn from the current crisis and \nto improve and strengthen the \nexisting framework in order to\n minimise the likelihood of cr\nises: we need new rules for \nfinancial markets in general, for banks in parti\ncular and for public finances. We have to \nanalyse more intensively the emergence of\n macroeconomic imbalances and scrutinise", "Page 4 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany\n www.bundesbank.de \n E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nstructural deficiencies. Fi\nnally, monetary policy framew\norks will have to integrate \nmacroprudential aspects. Neverthel\ness, in all areas we have to\n resist the temptation of \nregulatory and macroeconomic fine-tuning. Mark\nets have to remain the main tool for \ncoordination and we should not \nattempt to eliminate all ri\nsks. Risks and uncertainty are \nessential elements of a market economy. At the end, of course, it is \nimperative that the economic and \npolitical framework is broadly \nsupported by the public Œ and this is espec\nially true for the Eu\nropean Union and European monetary union. It is necessary to ensure that curr\nent measures to contain the debt crisis do \nnot cause a longer-term problem\n of general acceptance. The current framework includes \nlargely decentralised responsibility for fiscal po\nlicy and an independent m\nonetary policy that \nfocuses on price stability. This framework \nsets the range of meas\nures that monetary and \nfiscal policy can and should take Œ barring a fundamental revision. \nAgainst this general backdrop, let us now take \na look at some specific monetary and fiscal \npolicy issues which were discussed at this conference. \n2 Monetary and Fiscal Policy du\nring the Financial Crisis For any institution that attempts to stabilise\n the economy and the fi\nnancial system during a \ncrisis, two things are particularly import\nant: credibility and room for manoeuvre. Central \nbanks certainly had both. Thus, when liquidity dried up on financial markets and systemic \nbreakdown became a real threat, monetary poli\ncy acted as an important instrument of \nstabilisation. By applying a num\nber of non-standard measures, c\nentral banks took over the \nrole of the money market and supplied the financ\nial system with ample \nliquidity. Despite the", "Page 5 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany\n www.bundesbank.de \n E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nsuccess of this policy in prevent\ning a systemic breakdown, one sh\nould not forget the risk of \nadverse side effects in the long term. Sticki\nng to non-standard policy measures for too long \nwill not only change the percepti\non of risk in financial market\ns in an undesired manner but \nwill also preserve inefficient banking structures\n. History tells us this has been a key mistake \nin the aftermath of past financial crises. C\nonsequently, the question is not whether an exit \nfrom non-standard monetary policy is nece\nssary, but when it will take place. \nFiscal policy, too, contributed si\ngnificantly to preventing a downw\nard spiral at the height of \nthe crisis. It helped shore up the financial sector through guarantees, recapitalisation \nschemes and the set-up of bad \nbanks to relieve banks™ balanc\ne sheets, and it supported \naggregate demand through automatic \nstabilisers as well as di\nscretionary measures. How \neffective have these discretionary measures\n been? During this conference Walker and \nothers argued that the presence of\n a fiscal multiplier larger \nthan one is far from certain. \nOther papers presented duri\nng the conference clarified the conditions under which fiscal \nmultipliers may be large. One key aspect is t\nhe zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, \nwhich may amplify the effects of fiscal \npolicy, at least in the short run.  Let me add something on a personal note: What \nI learned during my years in government is \nthat in normal times discretionary fiscal policy is\n surely not an advisable tool of stabilisation. \nFar too many lags exist that reduce the effe\nctiveness of expansionary measures. Moreover, \nlooking at the long term, we have to bear in \nmind that political economy mechanisms bias \nfiscal policy towards incurring deficits. However, in\n an exceptional crisis\n things are slightly \ndifferent and it cannot be deni\ned that discretionary fiscal polic\ny had a stabilising effect. In \nthis connection the zero lower bound is certainl\ny a critical aspect, although its relevance \nmight be larger for the United States: Euro\nsystem experience shows that the lower bound \nrendering monetary policy ineffective might be less of an issue than commonly believed in", "Page 6 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany\n www.bundesbank.de \n E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nthe pre-crisis mainstream view. At least, non\n-standard measures seem to have prevented a \ngiven monetary policy stance Œ set by traditional\n interest rate instruments Œ from becoming \noverly restrictive during the crisis.  The sovereign debt crisis strongly reminded us \nthat, in the long run, only sound public \nfinances provide the necessary room for ma\nnoeuvre when a major shock occurs. And, even \nmore importantly, only sound public finances gener\nate the credibility that is necessary for \ndiscretionary measures to be effe\nctive. Once credibility is lost, fiscal multipliers become zero \nor might even turn negative. Furthermore, as l\nong as structural problems exist, stabilisation \ncannot be a substitute for reforms. In this regar\nd, the experience of past crises teaches us \nanother lesson: more often than \nnot, structural deficiencies ar\ne wrongly interpreted as a lack \nin aggregate demand, leading to \nan overstimulation of the ec\nonomy that may well lay the \nbasis for the next crisis. \nAs both fiscal policy and \nmonetary policy have to find an exit\n strategy, the question arises of \nhow the respective exits should be sequenced, gi\nven the interactions between the two policy \nareas. Angeloni, Faia, and Winkler took such \na perspective in thei\nr policy-oriented paper that simulates different exit scenarios. They\n make clear that in returning to normal \nconditions, fiscal and monetary \npolicy should work together. An \ninteresting result of the \nsimulations is that rapid consolidation by \nthe fiscal sector is preferable to gradual \napproaches. At the same time, spending-based \nconsolidation is preferable to revenue-\nbased consolidation. Regarding t\nhe sequence of fiscal and monetar\ny policy exits, Angelonie, \nFaia and Winkler find that fisca\nl policy should exit first. In Europe, we see a situation in\n which in some countries conf\nidence in public finances has \neroded massively, which in turn complicates matte\nrs for monetary policy.\n While this problem", "Page 7 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany\n www.bundesbank.de \n E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nis most pressing in the euro area\n, it is also relevant for other countries; fiscal dominance is \nno longer a mere theoretical not\nion but a real threat. This \nwas forgotten during the Great \nModeration but has now become a highly relevant issue. The world over, awareness of the urgent need \nfor fiscal consolidation has increased. \nHowever, confidence in the su\nstainability of public debt will \nonly stay firm, let alone be \nrestored where it is at stake,\n if this awareness quickly transla\ntes into credible and ambitious \nsteps to cut expenditure or raise revenue. \nOtherwise, it will be increasingly difficult to \nconvince investors and the public \nthat the alternatives to cons\nolidation, namely sovereign \ndefault or a debt-reducing inflation, can be \nruled out. The serious risks emanating from \nthese alternatives are discussed in thr\nee papers. Krause and Moyen highlight the \nquantitative effects of an increase in\n inflation targets in the Unit\ned States aimed at reducing \nthe real value of outstanding obligations, as\n discussed by Blanchard, Rogoff and others at \nvarious occasions. The applied model combines fo\nrward-looking interest rate determination \nin the presence of long-run debt and shows that\n short-term manipulati\nons of the inflation \nrate are not very effective in reducing the real\n value of government deb\nt. Rather, in addition \nto a high average maturity of outstanding gov\nernment debt it would take a persistent \nincrease in the expected inflatio\nn target to achieve a sizable \nreduction in the real debt \nburden. Such a policy is \ndefinitely not advisable: Apart from\n the costs associated with higher \ninflation, central bank \ncredibility, established in past de\ncades at great costs and now one of \nour most important assets, would be se\nriously or even critically damaged. The papers by Adam and Grill, as well as Uhlig, in\nvestigate the alternative,\n that is, disruptive \nmeans of reducing public debt: sovereign defaul\nt. It is easily overlooked that in advanced \neconomies, sovereign default is usually a polit\nical decision rather than an economic \nnecessity. Hence, understanding the reasons wh\ny governments decide to default on parts of", "Page 8 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany\n www.bundesbank.de \n E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \ntheir debt is crucial for developing strategies \non how to avoid such situations in the first \nplace. Adam and Grill address this fundament\nal question, and show \nthe conditions under \nwhich it is optimal for a country to occasiona\nlly default on its debt\n after large shocks. \nDefaults are rare events if they are costly \nfor a country. However, this result applies to a \nmodel without contagion across count\nries and perfectly insured in\nternational investors. Uhlig \ntackles these issues in the setting of a curr\nency union, taking into account many of the \nadditional aspects that complicat\ne the situation we face now. In\n his model, membership in a \nmonetary union and the resulting prospect of financial assist\nance to counter the risks of \ncontagion can extend a country™s borrowing \nconstraint and weaken the incentive to \nconsolidate. In the end, there \nis certainly a non-negligible risk \nof only delaying, rather than \naverting, a default. Because of this mechanism and the large risks bor\nne by the tax-payers of countries granting \nfinancial support, conditionality has to be a co\nre principle of such support programmes Œ \nincluding those launched in the European debt \ncrisis. Conditionality has two dimensions: \nEx ante, countries have to commit to a credible \nand frontloaded adjustment programme in order \nto get access to financial support, a programme that\n is suitable to restore the sustainability \nof, and thus confidence, in public debt. \nEx post\n, once financial support has started to flow, \ncompliance with the programme has to be monito\nred continuously, and deviations from the \nprogramme have to be corrected swiftly and convin\ncingly. If a country fails to do so, further \nsupport should no longer be tak\nen for granted and the country \nshould be prepared to bear \nthe severe consequences that are likely to ens\nue once financial assistance\n is withdrawn. It \nis true that in such a case the other me\nmber countries and their financial system would \nsuffer as well Œ being tough on vi\nolations of conditionality does \ncome at a price. But these \ncosts have to be weighed against the damage to \nlong-term stability of monetary union that \nwould result if the binding \nforce of support programmes and t\nhe no-bail-out principle were", "Page 9 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany\n www.bundesbank.de \n E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nultimately eroded. Shifting burd\nens to other member countries™ tax payers should not be \npermitted to appear to be a viable and attractive option. \nAgainst this background, current events in\n Greece have brought \nthe euro area to a \ncrossroads: the future character of European \nmonetary union will be det\nermined by the way \nin which this situation is handled. There can be \nno doubt that it is first and foremost up to \nGreece itself to take appropriate additional st\neps should it turn out that the adjustment \nprogramme is not on track. It is surely th\ne case that the conso\nlidation efforts and the structural reforms are far fr\nom easy to implement, entailing many hardships on the Greek \neconomy and the population. But \nthese measures are inevitable \nto restore the soundness of \npublic finances, and without financ\nial support from other member\n countries, the EU and the \nIMF, the immediately necessary adjustment would be much more severe. Conversely, ﬁreprofilingﬂ Greek bond maturities \ncannot substitute for fulfilling the adjustment \nprogramme. The sustainability of public finance\ns would hardly change, since a prolongation \nwould do nothing to improve the other factors \nthat determine the sustainability of the current \ndebt level: growth prospects and\n the primary surplus. Furthe\nrmore, a prolongation of Greek \ngovernment bonds in an environm\nent of prevailing strong doubts \nabout the sustainability of \npublic finances would make it impossible to \naccept them as collateral for refinancing \noperations under the existing rules of t\nhe Eurosystem™s collateral framework, and \nconsequently large parts of the \nGreek financial sector would be\n cut off from funding. In \naddition, the risks for contagion to other countrie\ns would significantly rise. Hence, proposals \nfor such a step seem to assume implicitly \nthat the Eurosystem would provide financial \nmeans against insufficient coll\nateral. But such a monetisati\non of public debt\n cannot be \ntolerated. Instead of blurring th\ne responsibilities of monetary \nand fiscal policy even further,", "Page 10 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany\n www.bundesbank.de \n E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nfiscal policy must take up its re\nsponsibility in fighting the so\nvereign debt crisis in the \nrespective countries and at the European level. \n3 Measures to Prevent Future Crises \nDealing with the imminent challenges of the cu\nrrent crisis, however, should not let us lose \nsight of the efforts to prev\nent future crises. Even when pr\noper fiscal consolidation has \nbrought public debt back to sustainable levels\n, this alone offers no guarantee against fiscal \npolicy getting off track again in \nthe future. History tells us that maintaining sound public \nfinances is a notoriously difficult task. Against this backdrop, Auerbach has discussed the \nusefulness of an independent fiscal entity \nwhich would to a certain degree mirror the \nindependent role of central banks.\n It is also reminiscent of a \nproposal made by Leeper for an ﬁoffice of independent thinkingﬂ. Long-term govern\nment commitments are usually not a topic \nof public debate, and if\n they are, the discussion is o\nften not based on sound facts or \nanalysis. Thus, better information and a debate \nat a higher level woul\nd allow the public to \nmake an informed judgment and put pressure on politicians. \nAlas, I am somewhat sceptical of\n this proposal Œ both in terms \nof political viability and with \nregard to the extent that t\nhe budget authority of elected \nparliaments can legitimately be \nconstrained to such an ext\nent. The independence of monetary \npolicy from the immediate \ninfluence of parliament and governm\nent seems to be rather the \nexception that proves the \nrule than a suitable recipe for rein\ning in other fields of economic\n policy, in particular fiscal \npolicy.", "Page 11 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany\n www.bundesbank.de \n E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nIn my view, however, the financial markets are \nfundamentally better at exerting discipline on \npolicy makers. Investors are less subject to\n the problems of moral hazard and time \ninconsistency that we usually run into \nwhen relying on policymakers to ensure fiscal \nsoundness. This confidence in fi\nnancial markets may come as a \nsurprise, given their recent track record in identifying risks early on. To act \nas more reliable correctives for fiscal policy, \nmarket participants have to assess risks timely\n and correctly and factor them into their \ninvestment decisions. The experience of t\nhe crisis has already led to a fundamental \nassessment of risks associated with various a\nssets. To ensure that markets effectively \ndiscipline fiscal policy it is equal\nly important that investors \nthemselves can expect to bear \nthe consequences of their investment decisions, t\nhat is to say, both profits and losses. This \nrequires a stronger instituti\nonal framework and an overhaul of\n financial market regulation \nwhich is currently under way. Relevant \naspects have been discussed in some papers \npresented at this conference. \nCooper and Kempf as well as Cukierman and Izhakian, for \ninstance, have discussed the problem of bailo\nuts with regard to their potential costs and \nbenefits or their impact on risk assessments. Markets are a powerful complement in disciplin\ning fiscal policy, but we should not rely on \nthem alone. Especially a m\nonetary union with decentralised fiscal policy needs a strong \nregulatory framework to prevent \nexcessive deficits in individual\n member states that might \nspill over negatively to the rest\n of the union. With regard to\n European monetary union, the \ncrisis has revealed that the existing fram\nework is not strong enou\ngh and hence needs to be \nstrengthened and broadened. \nRelevant reforms have already been agreed upon.\n They include a stre\nngthened Growth and \nStability Pact, a new mechanism for macroe\nconomic surveillance and a new mechanism to \ndeal with actual crises. In prin\nciple, the envisaged reforms aim in\n the right direction but are", "Page 12 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany\n www.bundesbank.de \n E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nfar too timid in some parts and of a flaw\ned design in others Œ t\nhe Bundesbank has on \nvarious occasions raised more detailed criticis\nms. Nevertheless, to make a rather general \npoint: Incentives for sound public finances and \nresponsible investment decisions must be \nstrengthened not weakened. Especially with regard \nto public finances, it is often overlooked \nthat fiscal soundness is not an \nend in itself. Instead, it is\n a precondition Œ albeit an \nindispensable one Œ for the continued success of \nthe euro, the single mo\nst important project \nof united Europe. We must not\n forget that the euro has de\nlivered enormous benefits so far. \nThe euro is a stable currency both externally and \ninternally Œ inflation \nhas been historically \nlow since its introduction Œ and during the financ\nial crisis, the common currency proved to be \na very important stabilising element. \n4 Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, you have dealt \nwith highly relevant but al\nso very complex issues at \nthis conference. Although research has made pr\nogress, the relevant questions are far from \nbeing resolved, and I am sure that\n there is scope for many furt\nher conferences. Seen in this \nlight, times have seldom been as exciting for ec\nonomic research as they are right now. I \nencourage you to continue with your work and wish you every success. Thank you very much for your attention. *    *    *"], "SECTION": "reden", "RECORD_ID": 607}
