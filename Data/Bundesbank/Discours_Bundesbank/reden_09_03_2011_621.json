Even so\n, the strong rebound in 2010 came as \na surprise \nto \nmany observe\nrs.\n  GDP growth \nwent down slightly \nto 0.4% in the \nfinal\n quarter of 2010, after 0.7% in \nthe third \nquarter \nand an \nexceptional \nsecond\n-quarter\n figure of\n 2.2%\n. Even so,\n the cyclical upswing is \nstill intact. \nThe most recent figure \nis \nbiased \nto some extent \nby \nthe\n heavy snowfalls and \nextreme\nly cold\n weather\n in December.\n In line with this picture of a stronger underlying \ndynamic, leading indicators suggest a rather favourable outcome for the first quarter of \n2011. \n Moreover, the upswing has \nrecently \ngained \nin \nbreadth\n. The previous economic upswing\n was \ndriven \nmainly\n by strong external demand\n, but\n ended incomplete\n. Unlike\n then\n, external \nimpulses are \nnow exerting \na greater impact \non domestic activity.\n Corporate\n investment\n has \nincreased\n significantly\n. Capacity utilisation\n is \ncontinu\ning\n to rise and is \nnow back \nat \nits long\n-term average\n. As a result, \nfirms are \nbecoming \nmore and more \nwilling \nto expand their \ncapacities rather than \njust replace existing equipment\n. Housing construction is expected to \ngo on \nbenefit\ning\n from histori\ncally low funding costs\n, whereas public investment is expected \nto drop sharply \ngiven the \nphasing\n-out of\n stimulus programmes and \nthe \nconsiderable \nneed \nfor \nconsolidation\n. Even private consumption \nis \nprovid\ning\n us with \nsome \ngood news. \nHaving been\n sluggish\n in \nthe past upswing and resilient during the crisis\n, it \nshowed perceptible growth of 0.4% \nin", "Embargo: 9 March 2011, 09:2\n0 p.m. GMT\n     Page \n4 of \n9 Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm\n-Epstein\n-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany\n www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse\n-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566\n 3511\n/3512\n  Fax: +49 69 9566\n 3077\n Reproduction is permitted only if source is stated\n. 2010. \nThe very \npositive household sentiment indicates that the upward trend will \nbecome \neven stronger\n both this year and next.\n What underl\nies\n this remarkably positive \nhousehold \nsentiment? \nQuite o\nbviously\n, it is the improved labour market situation and\n, hence,\n higher \nlabour income expectations. \n Consumption activity might suffer\n, however,\n from the \nsignificantly \ngloomier \nprice climate\n that\n will probably continue over the \nnext \nfew \nmonths.\n According to the flash estimate, t\nhe annual \ninflation rate (HICP) \nrose\n to 2.2% in February\n. Even though this \nis \nclearly\n lower than the \ncurrent UK inflation rates\n, it\n is \nthe highest \nfigure \nsince autumn 2008.\n The price climate has \ntherefore \ndeteriorated, \nalthough \nit should not be forgotten that\n, up to now\n, this \nhas been due \nmostly to exogenous shocks, particular\nly from energy prices.\n We expect the German economy to grow \non average in 2011 \nconsiderably \nfaster\n than \nthe \n2% we projected in early \nDecember\n: 2½% should be \na realistic \nfigure as things stand at \npresent\n. As a result, the German economy should \nregain\n its \ncrisis\n-related losses \nin output by \nabout the end of this year.\n There will be a further decline in u\nnemployment \nowing \nto companies™ \nmark\ned willingness to \nrecruit new staff\n. The fall in \nunemployment in Germany is not just cyclical\n, however\n. Germany is currently \nreaping the benefits\n of \nthe sometimes painful\n reforms \nintroduced over\n the past decade\n. This \nteaches us the important lesson that re\nforms pay off.\n Furthermore, \nrobust employment during the crisis was \nthe dividend \nof \ngreater \nflexibility in German \nwage \nagreements\n and \nwas \nalso supported by temporary \ngovernment \nmeasures\n such \nas \nthe short\n-time work\ning, which proved to be an attractive optio\nn. This is not to deny that \nmajor \nchallenges remain: The reforms have tended to \nreinforce\n the segmentation of the labour \nmarket, and unemployment among the low\n-skilled as well as long\n-term unemployment", "Embargo: 9 March 2011, 09:2\n0 p.m. GMT\n     Page \n5 of \n9 Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm\n-Epstein\n-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany\n www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse\n-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566\n 3511\n/3512\n  Fax: +49 69 9566\n 3077\n Reproduction is permitted only if source is stated\n. remain \nat a \nhigh\n level\n. Nevertheless, current data are\n impressive: \nat a rate of \n7.3%, German \nunemployment is \nnow \nbelow its pre\n-crisis level\n, and\n the average \nnumber of employed \npersons \nwas \nat its \nhighest ever\n in 2010\n. Public finances in Germany \nare \nbenefit\ning\n from the economic upswing, too. \nFollowing \na reversa\nl from a roughly balanced budget before the crisis to a \n3.0% \ndeficit ratio in 2009, t\nhe \n3.3% \ndeficit ratio in 2010 was considerably lower than \noriginally \nexpected. \nFor the current \nyear\n, we consider \nit feasible that there will be \na further decline \nin \nthe de\nficit ratio in the \norder \nof 2%, provided that \nfiscal policy stays committe\nd to consolidation\n. This relatively favourable \nŒ or, perhaps, this\n rather less serious \nŒ state of public finances allowed Germany to act as \nan anchor during the crisis. Still, the de\nficit \nhas \nexceeded the Maastricht threshold\n in \nGermany\n, too, \nand, even more importantly, the structural deficit is higher than \nit was \nbefore \nthe crisis. \nDevelopments \nwhich are better than expected \nshould \ntherefore \nbe used for \nmore \nambitious deficit reducti\non rather than \nfor \nexpenditure increases\n. The objective of a \nstructurally almost balanced budget\n, which is mandated by \nboth \nEuropean \nand national law\n, calls for \nconsiderable \nfurther efforts in \nconsolidation.\n To sum up, \nGermany \ncan serve in various \nrespects\n as a role\n model for other \neuro\n-area \nmember states, particular\nly those affected by the current sovereign debt crisis\n and faced \nwith structural adjustment need\ns.

Ireland was justifiable, too, taking into account the spill\n-over risks \nto financial stability in the \nEuropean Union.\n The stabilisation measures have nevertheless s\nhaken the foundations of EMU. \nIt is \ntherefore \nvital\n that European leaders take the right decisions during the next \nfew \nweeks \nwhen it comes to overhaul\ning\n the governance of the European monetary union. \nThe final \npackage should not fall \nshort of \nwhat \nwas\n agr\need by policymakers at the end of last year.\n In addition\n, it is imperative that \nmember states \ncontinue\n to \nconsolidate their public budgets \nand to initiate comprehensive reforms\n in order \nto address \nthe \nstructural problems \nin their \neconomies\n.

While the former ﬁsick man of Europeﬂ, Germany, has \nemer\nged \nas \none of the fastest\n-growing economies in the euro area, countries \nthat were \ngrowing quickly earlier \nstill haven™t emerged from recession. With regard to inflation \nvariance\n, we see \nlarger \nstandard deviations than in the mid\ndle\n of the past decade but l\nower \nvalues than in the first years of EMU.\n Secondly\n, it has to be stressed that the monetary policy decisions of the ECB Governing \nCouncil \nare focused on the euro area as a whole and not on the \nspecific \nneeds of \nindividual \nmember states\n, let alone individ\nual banks with funding problems\n. Consequently, \ndevelopments in individual member countries are relevant \nto monetary policy \nonly \ninsofar as \nthey have an impact on \nprice stability in the euro area\n as \na whole\n; this can occur directly via \nthe\nir impact on aggre\ngate inflation\n, but also indirectly, \nsay,\n if the \nmonetary policy \ntransmission process is affected.\n  Finally\n, heterogeneity is not a problem \nper se\n, that is to say \nit is a problem \nneither for \nthe \nsingle monetary policy nor \nfor the individual member states:\n Persistent heterogeneity \nin \ngrowth rates might simply reflect differences in potential output growth \ncaused,\n for example\n, by differ\ning\n demographic developments or \nthe \ncatch\n-up processes in some member states. \nRather, \nwhat we should be concerned about\n is he\nterogeneity in \nterms of \nthe member states\n™ ability\n to cope with \n and to live up to \n the challenges of a common monetary policy\n.

Nevertheless, \nit can be argued \nthat disparities are more likely to \nnarrow \nthan \nwiden\n over the medium term\n. Some \neuro\n-area \ncou\nntries, including Germany\n, have \nrecovered\n very dynamically \nfrom the economic crisis\n. Other countries, particular\nly those\n at \nthe peripher\ny, are persistently suffering from structural \nadjustment requirements \nand are constantly \nunder the scrutiny of financial\n markets. \nNevertheless, the implementation of necessary reforms and adjustment processes is the \nonly \nviable \nway \nof return\ning\n to a sustainable growth path. On the other hand, we should not \noverestimate Germany™s economic strength over the medium term. The e\nconomic crisis has \nsubdued the potential growth of the German economy\n. We assume \nthat \npotential growth \nwill go up again \nslightly to \nno more than\n 1% by 2012. \n Heterogeneity in the euro area does not constrain the conduct of a stability\n-oriented \nsingle \nmonet\nary policy.\n Nevertheless\n, its \nfull \nbenefits will materiali\nse only \nif \nthe member states™ \neconomic policies and economic structures\n are sufficiently flexible and adaptable. \nA reform \nof euro\n-area economic governance \nthat reinforces individual responsibilities\n, and structural \nreforms in the member states themselves are key\n to ensuring this\n.
