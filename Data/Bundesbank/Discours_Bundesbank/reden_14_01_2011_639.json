It is a pleasure to be here once again. The beginning of a new year lends itself to looking back and reflecting on the past year which turned out satisfactory Œ all the more so as the \neconomic outlook has brightened considerably.  This is not just true for Germany but also for the euro area in general. Hence, even though for the euro area risks for the economic outlook ar\ne still tilted slightly \nto the downside, the \nrecovery should continue. Against this background, the recent increase of inflation in the \n\neuro area above 2% has attracted some attention. Whilst this is largely the result of short-\nterm upward pressure on prices, mainly owing to energy prices, inflationary pressures over the policy-relevant medium term are expected \nto remain contained and in line with price stability. Therefore, the Govern\ning Council yesterday confirmed that the current key interest \nrates still remain appropriate. Nevertheless, ri\nsks to the medium term outlook for inflation", "page 3 of 9 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n  Wilhelm-Epstein-Straße 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de \n E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel.: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nwhich are so far still broadly balanced coul\nd well move to the upside. Thus, price \ndevelopments have to be monitored very closely. In spite of the favourable economic outlook, the \nfinancial and economic crisis is not over yet, \nand even though Germany fared much better duri\nng the crisis than many other advanced economies, the welfare losses \nhave been huge. Thus, one of our top concerns must be to ensure that measures are taken to prevent the occurrence of another crisis of this scale. But first, I would like to address the issue of r\negulatory reform on financial markets. So let us \ntake a look back and cast a look at the interlinkages between the real economy and the financial system and at how \nthe crisis originated. 2 The financial system Œ driver of growth, but also the origin of the \nworst crisis in the post-war period The state of the real economy and economic well\n-being are usually measured in terms of \neconomic growth. As you will probably recall \nfrom your macroeconomic courses, simple \ntextbook models basically identify three determining factors of economic growth: capital, \n\nlabour and technological progress. Of those th\nree, the one most obviously affected by the \nfinancial sphere is the first Œ capital. Considered on its own, the financial sector not only \nplays a crucial role in capital accumulation but is also a part \nof the economy with a distinct value added that contributes to an economy™s \ngrowth. Beyond that, however, the financial system performs another very important task with regard to economic growth: it not only \nfunds innovations but also helps\n in identifying them. The financial system therefore helps to further the state of know-how and promotes technological progress. Sound economic growth \nrelies upon an efficient financial system. Wi\nth each advancing stage of economic", "page 4 of 9 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n  Wilhelm-Epstein-Straße 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de \n E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel.: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \ndevelopment, the financial system also refines and increases its complexity together with \nadvancements in the real economy. \nThe massive repercussions and enormous costs \nfor the real economy during the current \ncrisis have demonstrated impressively how impor\ntant financial stability is for economic \nperformance and welfare: The sec\nond phase of the crisis, that is after the Lehman Brothers insolvency in September 2008, not only marked the \npoint of conversion to a systemic crisis, causing transactions on the interbank market to virtually ground to a halt, stock prices  to plummet and investors to flee to the safety of government bonds. T\nhe disruptions of the financial system were also \npassed on to the real economy. Financing conditions for \nenterprises and households tight\nened, and as consumers and firms feared what was still to \ncome, expectations in the private sector as well as the outlook for the world economy deteriorated sharply. As a result, manufacturing and trade were at the heart of the crisis and suffered globally, and particularly in the advanced economies, output dropped at rates hitherto unseen in the post-war period.  Financial stability has therefore \nrightly become a top priority on the policy agenda, and the \nincreasing role of the G20 testifies to the global dimension of this task. Yet the objective is \nnot to avoid financial crises completely. Histor\nically, these crises have occurred regularly \nover time and can be viewed as an element of \nmarket economies. In th\nis context, attempts to increase financial market stability should therefore not be understood as an attempt to \navoid crises altogether, but as an attempt to\n increase the system™s resilience and, by doing \nso, to limit the dire consequences.  \nThe usual fear is that stricter regulation may introduce additional frictions and hamper economic growth. The challenge policy makers face when reforming the regulatory", "page 5 of 9 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n  Wilhelm-Epstein-Straße 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de \n E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel.: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nframework of financial markets lies in striking the right balance between the stability of the financial system and its efficiency. Luckily, bot\nh intentions are to a significant degree \ncomplementary, and the context \nis not that of a zero-sum game. Well-designed regulatory \nreform can make the financial system more stable \nwithout cutting into sustainable growth. In order to construct regulation wisely, it is first necessary to understand the underlying \nreasons for the current crisis. Otherwise regulation runs the risk of curing the symptoms but not the cause.  Prior to the crisis, the global economy grew at\n a rapid pace. The integration of rapidly \ncatching-up emerging markets contributed largely to this significant\n upturn. The labour \npotential, that is the number of people who are readily available to the labour market, \nincreased greatly in these economies and they presented plenty of\n high-yielding investment \nopportunities. Both led to a significant growth in per capita income. However, the phase \nbefore the crisis was also characterised by extremely favourable financing conditions and a \nhigh propensity to take risks. As a result, capital was not always channelled into its most \nproductive use, and in various countries this fostered an unsus\ntainable asset price increase that led to high private-sect\nor debt and excess domestic demand; the housing markets in several advanced economies are a prominent \nexample. These undesirable developments \nwere further encouraged by loopholes and weaknesses in the \nregulatory framework. Eventually, the underlying imbalances erupted and ca\nme to the surface; we still have to deal \nwith those consequences. The deficiencies of the financial system that\n reinforced the unhealthy development were \nmany and encompassed the microeconomic as we\nll as the macroeconomic level. On the \nmicroeconomic level the factors that led to the financial cr\nisis were a lack of transparency, \ninsufficient capital buffers, the unhampered dev\nelopment of a scarcely regulated shadow", "page 6 of 9 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n  Wilhelm-Epstein-Straße 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de \n E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel.: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nbanking system and moral hazard, for example in the form of ill-designed remuneration \nschemes or an insufficient risk and liquidit\ny management at the level of individual \ninstitutions, to name but a few. Furthermore, \nthe systematic importance of certain agents, ie \ntheir crucial role they played for whole financial market s\negments, had been underestimated for too long. 3 Regulatory reform as a lesson to be learned from the crisis \nWhere the causes are multilayered, multilayered regulation is \nthe appropriate measure. As a first line of defence, the microprudential level of regulation will be strengthened. The measures that policy-makers set up in September 2010 and agreed on at the G20 summit in Seoul, commonly termed ﬁBasel IIIﬂ, comprise\n higher capital and liquidity requirements which are intended to enable an institution to better cope with losses itself and thus lower \nthe probability of it™s insolvency. In this context, higher capi\ntal requirements mean both, a \nhigher quantity of capital as well as a higher quality. Particularly, the \nminimum core capital requirements will rise from currently 2% to then 4.5%, plus an ex\ntra 2.5% that will be \nintroduced in stages from 2016 on. Tier 1 capital requirements will increase from currently \n4% to then 8.5%. Furthermore, a stricter definition of core c\napital is to be implemented.  Yet, this first line of defence is not sufficient and needs to be supplemented. In market-\nbased economies the failure of individual enterpri\nses, including banks, should not be ruled \nout a priori. Thus, a second line of defence will be drawn, on the macroprudential level, which will only come into play if an institution breaks the first line of defence and becomes \ninsolvent. Its aim will be to curtail the impact of individual insolvencies on the financial \nsystem as a whole and to increase the financ\nial system™s transparency. The European", "page 7 of 9 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n  Wilhelm-Epstein-Straße 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de \n E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel.: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nUnion only recently established an institution for macroprudential analysis and monitoring in \norder to recognise systemic risks early \non, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). Germany passed a law on the restructuring of \ninsolvent financial instit\nutions last autumn, which is certainly a step to be welcomed. \nHowever, the various national restructuring mechanisms will only be fully effect\nive if they are mutually com\npatible. As in other areas of regulation, this requires an internationally coordinated approach.  Additionally, measures of \nmacroprudential oversight are cu\nrrently being developed and implemented also to address systemic risk. \nDealing with systemic risk is complex and requires a multi-faceted approach. It should \nencompass systemically relevant financial \ninstitutions, markets and infrastructures, while transparency is crucial.  Topics that either still need further\n discussion or at least ratifi\ncation include, for example, the question of how exactly to deal with institutions \nthat are ﬁtoo big to failﬂ. Stricter regulation and more intense supervision lead, not least, to the internalisation of otherwise negative \nexternal effects of these institutions. The improvement of corporate governance, not least \nthe implementation of the FSB™s international compensation standards, is also the subject of \ndebate. Further topics on the agenda are the mandatory registrati\non of institutions that currently operate in the shadow banking system, and the standardisation of contracts and handling of derivatives. All these topics need to \nbe concretised further. Once implemented, these measures will have a profound impact on the financial \nsystem. They will increase the system™s resilience and, \nwith that, its stability. Especially with Basel III there have been concerns that the increased capital requirements \nwill have a potentially negative impact on econom\nic performance. However, studies have revealed that these fears are not well-founded. In anticipation of the new rules banks have", "page 8 of 9 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n  Wilhelm-Epstein-Straße 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de \n E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel.: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nalready started to increase their capital. Additionally, the transition period before the new \nrequirements fully enter into force has been set with a long horizon. These are clear signs \nthat policy-makers have found the right balance\n between regulation for stability and ensuring \nstrong and sustainable growth. In fact, there is no inherent conflict between the G20 agenda‚s objectives of a more stable financial system and of strong, sustainable and balanced growth. \nWhat we have to be careful with is public debt. The (sadly) new feature of the current crisis \nhas been its third phase, the debt crisis, which hit us hard in May 2010. Towards the end of \n2009, investors and rating agencies were increasingly turning their attention to the financial \nrisks that the government sector worldwide had already incurred or\n was likely to incur. The \ndefault risk of these countries™ government debt securities had until then been considered \nsafe. However, with deteriorating public debt through fiscal programmes and guarantees to \nfinancial institutions in particular as rescue measures, the default risk was revalued on a more differentiated basis. As a result, intra-euro-area yield spreads \nwidened significantly Œ especially to the detriment, above all, of periphery countries like Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Although this third phase of the crisis has so far not impacted significantly on euro-\narea economic developments, and financial market\ns have continued to recover, too, the \nsovereign debt crisis still poses a serious challenge for the eur\no area as a whole that needs to be resolved before it potentially becomes a more serious threat to the recovery. Policy-\nmakers have already taken important first steps in this rega\nrd, both to embark on ambitious \nand timely consolidation as well as to strengthen the institutional framework within the EU. \nKeywords in this context are a strengthened Stability and Growth Pact, better enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances and a crisis resolution \nmechanism that helps to deal with future cris\nes but does not underminde the incentives to rein in public deficits.", "page 9 of 9 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n  Wilhelm-Epstein-Straße 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de \n E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel.: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \n4 Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, the major drivers of growth for the world economy have not been impaired by the financial crisis. Emerging markets are still undertaking great efforts to catch up, and technological progress will continue. As \nI pointed out, even the regulatory measures \nalready implemented, as well those measures\n that will be implemented once the discussion \nprocess has come to an end, will not hamper fundamental economic growth. The crisis has \nwarned us of the risks of exaggerated growth and has painfully demonstrated some major \nweaknesses of the regulatory syst\nem. But the crisis does not mark the end of the world as we know it. If we manage to improve the regulatory framework for the financial system and maintain well-disciplined government budgets, \nwe will be well on the way towards strong, \nsustainable and balanced growth in the future.
