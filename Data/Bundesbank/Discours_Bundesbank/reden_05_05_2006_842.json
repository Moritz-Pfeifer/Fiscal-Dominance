Most of you will know that I \nmyself organised this event from 1999 until 2003. So be warned: \nmy review of this conference and its impact might be slightly positively biased!  But nevertheless, my primary co\nnclusion is very likely to be\n undisputed. For good reasons, \nthe ECB watcher conferences organised by \nthe CFS have become a central part of the \nyearly agenda for everyone interested in a serious monitoring of European monetary policy.  \nStarting in 1999, we wanted the conference to fulfil three main functions:  Firstly, the professional \nECB watchers should be provi\nded with a regular platform for \ncommunicating their evaluation of ECB policy actions directly to the ECB policy \nmakers (rather than addressing them indirectly through the press).   Secondly, the conferences should give\n ECB representatives\n the opportunity to \ndirectly respond to the watchers™ assessments.   Finally, the conferences should generate \nan intellectual competition among the \nvarious monitoring groups. Reviewing the conferences that have taken place so far, \nI can conclude that, happily, these \nobjectives have been achieved.", "Page 3 of 6 Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nEspecially the direct communica\ntion between watchers and ECB officials is a special asset \nand a central part of the uniqueness of these events.  One could add that the conferences have not\n only generated an intellectual competition \namong watcher groups, but have also posed an in\ntellectual challenge to the ECB and its \nofficials participating in a wide array of panels.  As a result, not only the public, but also the EC\nB and the entire Eurosystem have learnt a lot \nfrom the exchange with watcher groups in the context of the annual watcher conferences.  Over the years, the topics discu\nssed at these events have cover\ned all issues that were and \nare still highly relevant for monetary policy \nin EMU. Let me give you some examples:  Monetary policy strategy  \n Monetary and fiscal policy coordination  \n Central bank communication  \n European financial integration  \n EU enlargement  \n International role of the euro  \n Global imbalances \nBut I do not want to provide you with further det\nails with respect to these topics. The large \nnumber of distinguished speakers (also at \ntoday™s conference), the large number of \ninterested participants and the wide \npress coverage tell me that I do not need to elaborate \nfurther on the relevance of these issues for European monetary policy. \n I would, rather, like to stress another face\nt: eight annual ECB watcher conferences also", "Page 4 of 6 Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nmean eight consecutive appearances \nof Otmar Issing at this event\n. Therefore, I would like to \ntake a closer look at Otmar's role in these conferences. \nOtmar Issing™s role From the very beginning, the hi\nstory of the ECB watcher conf\nerence has been inextricably \nlinked to Otmar Issing.  \n Firstly, because I organised the first conferenc\ne in 1999 in close cooperation with him. \nSecondly, because he has participated in ev\nery conference since it\n was established, \nproviding explanations, comments,\n replies, opening or concluding remarks. A pretty good \ntrack record!   \nThroughout all the years as t\nhe ECB™s chief economist, Otmar \nIssing has always stressed \nthe importance of communicati\non and transparency for an effective monetary policy. His \nannual participation in the watc\nher conferences shows just how rigorously he personally \nsticks to these two principles. His unbroken par\nticipation is a concrete example of central \nbank transparency and communication policy in action.  \n \nIt also reflects Otmar Issi\nng™s general open-mindedness towards sceptics and outright critics \nalike. As an example, let me briefly recall \nthe controversial issue ab\nout whether or not the \nEurosystem should use its two-pillar-strategy\n for conducting monetary\n policy, or, more \ngenerally speaking, whet\nher or not monetary aggregates s\nhould play a prominent role in \nmonetary policy, a question of ongoing relevance.  \n \nIn this context, substantial criticism has b\neen voiced in recent y\nears Œ not least during previous watcher conferences. Nevertheless, Ot\nmar Issing always chose to face his critics", "Page 5 of 6 Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \ndirectly at such events in order to patient\nly and repeatedly explain t\nhe whys and wherefores \nunderpinning the Eurosystem™s current monetary policy strategy.  \n Let me conclude my short review with the fo\nllowing, rather personal\n thoughts regarding \nOtmar Issing™s legacy. At each \nof the previous watcher conf\nerences, I was impressed by \nOtmar™s mild-mannered, calm styl\ne coupled with his resolute atti\ntude. Otmar made it a habit \nto deal personally with each ch\nallenge. This commitment and \ntenacity is probably why he \nhas enjoyed such an outstanding career as\n one of the few economists who have been \nexceptionally successful as an academic, as a policy advisor and, finally, as a policy maker.  \n His pragmatic approach to monetary policy wa\ns based on a number of\n strong convictions: \nthe desirability of stable money, the need to take\n a medium-term policy perspective and the \nusefulness of exposing theories to\n the rigour of real-world data \nin order to draw inferences \nabout their reliability for policy decisions.  \n\n As regards his work at the ECB, I would co\nnclude that Otmar Issi\nng was the brain behind \nthe ECB™s monetary policy strategy \nin the first years of EMU. Or, in other words, during this \ntime, he was the implicit third pillar of this strategy.  \n Again and again, he has stressed t\nhe utmost importance of such\n an explicit strategy for \nmonetary policy. In doing so, he has been quite successful in implementing a policy focusing \non steadiness and medium-term objectives, thus\n fostering stability and hence the foundation \nof the policy itself.  \n In addition, the Eurosystem™s monetary poli\ncy strategy has another advantage: monetary \npolicy becomes largely independe\nnt of the influence of individual policy makers.", "Page 6 of 6 Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nTo a certain degree, an explicit\n monetary policy strategy leads\n to a ﬁdepersonalisationﬂ of \nmonetary policy. In this vein, monetary policy \nis likely to gain steadiness and predictability \neven at times when the composition of the policy making body changes.   Against the background of Otmar \nIssing™s prominent influence over \nthe last eight years, this \nconclusion might seem paradox at\n first sight, but let me elab\norate. Precisely because Otmar \nIssing has been so successful in nurturing the \nEurosystem™s monetary policy strategy and \nthus the underlying basis for the stable euro, hi\ns forthcoming retirement at the end of May \nwill not change the fundamental principles of the single European monetary policy. \n*    *    *"], "SECTION": "reden", "RECORD_ID": 842}
