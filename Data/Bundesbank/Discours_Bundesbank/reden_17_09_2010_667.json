Occasions like this which provide a \nplatform for students to meet professionals ar\ne an agreeable complement to academic \nstudy. This symposium has traditionally been or\nganised by first-year students who, I must \nsay, appear to have done very well in performing their task.  2 Growth and the financial system Œ some general remarks \nThe topic of this year™s symposium is ﬁGro\nwth Œ A Future Without Boundariesﬂ. Economic \ngrowth is widely associated or even equated with pr\nosperity, and in light of the current crisis \nthe topic is receiving a lot of attention: After \nall, the crisis not only resulted in the most \npronounced downturn since World \nWar II, for many it also \ncast doubt on the path of \neconomic activity once the crisis is over. Ne\nvertheless, if we wish \nto make a sound and", "page 3 of 7 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \ncomprehensive judgement it is \nnot advisable to look only at \ncurrent gross domestic product \n(GDP). Economic growth is a concept that \nembraces a longer-term perspective and we \nwould be well advised to look beyond the curr\nent crisis. The concept\n of potential output \npermits a calm and objective view of the matter.\n Abstracting from cyclical fluctuations, it \ncovers the medium to long-term trend of GDP and \nlinks it to the driving factors for such a \ntime horizon.  To be more specific and to fo\ncus our minds on the lasting econo\nmic impact of the crisis, it \nhelps to take a simple textbook \nmodel of economic growth as a \nstarting point. In this stylised \nmodel, growth is determined by three factors: \ncapital, labour and te\nchnical progress. How \nare these three factors, in turn, affected by \nthe financial system? The first factor Œ capital Œ \npoints perhaps most obviously to the import\nance of the financial system. After all, the \nfinancial sector is not only a par\nt of the economy with a distinct \nvalue added, it also plays a \ncrucial role in capital accumulation. However,\n especially in highly \ndeveloped economies that \ntypically boast sizeable and sophisticated financ\nial sectors, the role of the financial system \ngoes far beyond that of mere capital accumulati\non. In such economies,\n the financial system \nplays a key role in identifying and funding innov\nations, thus helping to advance the state of \ntechnical knowledge and promoti\nng technological progress. Fo\nr these reasons Œ and leaving \naside additional effects due \nto the labour force and invest\nment in human capital Œ an \nefficient financial system is\n indispensable for growth and\n necessarily becomes more \ncomplex with each advancing stage of economic development.  In a sense, even the crisis with its massive\n repercussions for the real economy and its \nenormous costs illustrates how important t\nhe financial system and its stability are for \neconomic performance and welfar\ne. Consequently, financial stability has become a top \npriority on the global policy agenda. But stability \nis not an end in itself. Historical record tells \nus that financial crises have always been an el\nement of market econom\nies. Therefore, the", "page 4 of 7 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nobjective should not be to avoid them entirely \nbut rather to contain their consequences. Put \ndifferently, the challenge for regulatory reforms is to strike\n the right balance between the \nstability of the financial system and its efficiency.\n And, given the experience of the past few \nyears as well as the channels through which t\nhe financial system affects economic growth, \nthe two objectives are, to a significant degree, \ncomplementary. This m\neans that the trade-off \nbetween stability and efficiency should not \nbe seen as a zero-sum\n game. Well-designed \nregulatory reform should make the financial \nsystem more stable without cutting into \nsustainable growth. 3 The crisis, regulatory reform and future growth \nThe strength and scale of the \nfinancial crisis were unfores\neeable. There had been warnings about various exaggerations and \nundesirable developments. But per\nceptions of where these \nmight lead fell well shor\nt of the reality when it\n actually materialised. Prior to the crisis, the \nglobal economy had been growing at a rapid pace. This was due,\n not least, to the fact that \nemerging markets were becoming increasingly \nintegrated. This set free a large labour \npotential, provided high-yieldi\nng investment opportunities, and le\nd to significant growth in \nper capita income. Another driving factor b\nehind growth was less benign, however. In too \nmany areas, capital was not a\nlways channelled into the most \nproductive areas. Consider the \nhousing market in some advanced economies as \na point in case. An environment in which \ninterest rates were exceptionally low as we\nll as loopholes and weaknesses in the regulatory \nframework acted as catalysts for these \nundesirable and, ultimately, unsustainable \ndevelopments. Eventually, the \nunderlying imbalances erupted an\nd suddenly  came to the \nsurface Œ with the well-known cost\ns. The situation in which t\nhe global economy found itself \nwas comparable to a rose bush that had sprout\ned too many new buds too quickly. The new", "page 5 of 7 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nrosebuds had many attractive blossoms but as s\noon as it started to ra\nin, most of them had \nno support and broke off. Against this background, what are the defici\nencies of the financial system that have to be \nremedied? At the microeconomic level, a whol\ne cocktail of different factors led to the \nfinancial crisis. These included a general lack of transparency, insufficient capital buffers, \nthe development of a scarcely regulated s\nhadow banking system, and moral hazard in \nvarious forms Œ owing to ill-designed remuneration \nschemes, for example, \nor insufficient risk \nand liquidity management at\n the level of individual institut\nions. At the macroeconomic level, \nin particular, the pivotal role of certain agen\nts and their influence on financial markets Œ in \nother words, their systematic importance Œ was underestimated for too long.  \nIn order to prevent the rose \nbush from sprouting too many w\neak buds and blossoms again, \nreforms at both the micro and macro levels ar\ne needed to make the financial system more \nresilient to future shocks. As a first line of\n defence, the microprudentia\nl level of regulation \nneeds to be strengthened. The measures that\n have been proposed include higher capital \nand liquidity requirements. These are intended to\n lower the probability \nof an institution™s \ninsolvency by enabling it to cope better with lo\nsses. Proposals for reform were published by \nthe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in December 2009. The discussion is \nwell advanced. A final proposal was adopted \nlast weekend, and t\nhe G20 meeting in November will yield a final decision. As a resu\nlt, financial institutions will be requested to \nhold not only a higher quantity of\n capital in their books but also\n capital of increased quality: \nminimum core capital requirements will go up from\n 2% to 4.5%, for Tier 1 capital from the \ncurrent 4% to 6%. This will be supplemented by\n an additional buffer of\n 2.5% built up of \ncommon equity. This is designed to enable banks to absorb losses during periods of \neconomic and financial disruptions. Furthermore, a st\nricter definition of \ncore capital will be \napplied.", "page 6 of 7 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nYet, this first line of defence needs to be s\nupplemented. In a market-based economy it is \nneither possible nor desirable to\n entirely prevent the failure of\n individual enterprises. Thus, a \nsecond line of defence has to be drawn at the \nmacroprudential level of re\ngulation in order to \ncontain the impact of individual bank failures\n on the financial system\n as a whole and to \nmake the financial system more transparent. This \npart of the reform pr\nocess is being dealt \nwith by the FSB. Major topics on its agenda ar\ne the handling of system\nically important \nfinancial institutions and \nthe ﬁtoo-big-too-failﬂ problem, resolu\ntion regimes, the role of rating \nagencies, harmonising accounting standards, \nand rolling back trading in OTC derivatives. \nEven though these issues seem to have a\nttracted less attention than Basel III, I am \nconfident that we shall see significant progress in this area by the time of the G20 meeting in November as well. Once implemented, the reforms at the mi\ncroprudential and the macroprudential levels will \nhave a profound impact on the financial system, \nincreasing its resilience and hence its \nstability significantly. But, going back to what I sa\nid earlier, do the reforms also strike the \nright balance between stability and growth? I am \ncertain they do. True,\n the development of \nthe new Basel III proposals has been accompanied by\n concerns that such tighter regulation \nmight have a negative impact on economic performa\nnce by severely restricting access to \ncredit. Several studies on the potential effects \nof the new regulatory requirements on the \neconomy have been published recently. A co\nmprehensive cost-benefit analysis has \nrevealed that such fears of a si\ngnificant negative impact on grow\nth are unfounded. This is all \nthe more the case given that \nthere will be the trans\nition period before the new requirements \nenter fully into force, which will give banks sufficient time to strengthen their capital base.  \nThis favourable overall assessment of \nthe macroeconomic impact of well-designed \nregulatory reform highlights t\nhe fact that there is no inhe\nrent conflict between the G20 \nagenda™s objectives of a more\n stable financial system \nand of ensuring strong and", "page 7 of 7 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nsustainable growth. And, in terms\n of the general future outlook \nfor growth, we should bear in \nmind that the financial crisis has not impaired ma\njor drivers of growth. Emerging markets, for \ninstance, will still make great \nefforts to catch up, and technica\nl progress will continue. Thus, \nthe crisis certainly does not mark the end\n of economic growth\n. Rather, what it \nhas done is \nhighlight the importance of \nsustainable growth and the need for supportive policies Œ in \nfinancial regulation, but also in many other policy areas. 4 Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, the events and\n implications of the current financial crisis have clearly \ndemonstrated how vulnerable \nour financial system has been\n. The necessity of reform \ncannot be denied, financial stability \nhas to and will be reinforced. However, as said earlier, \nenhancing financial stability is not an \nend in itself nor is it an obsta\ncle to growth. Rather, it is \na major prerequisite. Regulatory reform along\n the lines currently proposed lowers the \nprobability of crises occurring as well as thei\nr impact, but does not unduly hamper access to \nfunding for consumers and firms. The outcome will \nbe a significant improvement in welfare \nin the long run.  Thank you for your attention. *    *    *"], "SECTION": "reden", "RECORD_ID": 667}
