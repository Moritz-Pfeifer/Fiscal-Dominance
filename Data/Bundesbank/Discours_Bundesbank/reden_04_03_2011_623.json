With the removal of barriers to t\nhe worldwide flow of ideas, services, goods and \ncapital, a global economy emer\nged. This has brought about a la\nrge increase in welfare and \nstill harbours huge potential for further economic\n growth and prosperity. During the past \nyears, growth in the world economy has\n become increasingly unbalanced, however. A \nvisible expression of these imbalances are di\nvergences in current account positions. \nAlthough these imbalances were not the ultimate cause of the \nfinancial crisis, they did play a \nrole in the build-up of unsustainable structur\nes. This sparked public debate regarding the \noptions to rebalance the world economy and secu\nre sustainable long-term growth. Let us \nfirst take a look at recent developments with \nregard to global imbalances and then discuss \nsome policy options to address these imbalances.", "Page 3 of 6 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \n2 Global rebalancing: Recen\nt trends and perspectives Over the past two and a half years we have wit\nnessed a partial correction of current account \nimbalances which was mainly driven by exter\nnal adjustments in deficit countries and by \nlower surpluses in commodity exporting count\nries. However, the IMF forecasts a renewed \ndivergence of current account positions. While \nthe current account of the euro area as a \nwhole will remain broadly in balance, future\n trends in global imbal\nances will be determined \nmainly by the United States\n on the deficit side and by Em\nerging Asia and oil-exporting \ncountries on the surplus side. According to these forecasts, the current account\n deficit of the United\n States will increase \nslightly until 2015, while the Ch\ninese current account surplus \nis expected to increase more \nsharply. The medium-term outlook, however, is\n uncertain as the Chinese government has \noutlined a new plan to raise domestic demand. \nCurrent account surpluses in oil-exporting \ncountries have not returned to pre-crisis levels\n, but given the recent hi\nke in oil prices the \nsurpluses might increase faster than initially\n expected. To sum up, current developments \nsuggest that global imbalances \nwill grow again and remain unco\nmfortably large over the \ncoming years, albeit at below pr\ne-crisis levels. Thus, there is good reason to further discuss \npolicy options to rebalance the world economy. 3 Policy options to reduce global imbalances \nIn principle, current account surpluses or defic\nits are not a problem in themselves. However, \nthe ones we have been observing \nat the global level are an \nexpression of underlying \nbarriers to sustainable growth\n and, at the same time, add an \nelement of instability to the \nglobal economy. The US current\n account deficit, for example, has reflected a general", "Page 4 of 6 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \ndecline in saving. Desp\nite an ageing population and foreseeable increases in health and \nage-related expenditures, public saving has det\neriorated. At the same time household \nsavings have declined due to increased bo\nrrowing against rising house values. The \ncounterpart to the US current a\nccount deficits were surpluses in emerging markets such as \nChina and some oil-exporting \ncountries. For the latter group of countries, the surpluses can \npartly be explained by an increase\n in oil prices. Nevertheless,\n current account surpluses \nwere also caused by exchange rate policies \nthat some countries pursued to artificially \nsupport their export sectors. Given the malign nature of these persistent differences in \ncurrent account positions the term \nglobal imbalances is indeed just\nified, and it is necessary to\n address them. However, when \ndesigning relevant measures, it is imperative \nnot to underestimate the complexity of the \nproblem. A country™s current acc\nount position is driven by a very diverse set of underlying \nfactors from within and outside\n its borders. Consequently, any sensible approach to \nreducing current account imbalances should not \naim at steering them di\nrectly. Instead, the \nobjective should be to creat\ne circumstances in which current account positions are \ndetermined by efficient and unbiased market decis\nions. In this context, the question of which \ncountries have to act to correct the global im\nbalances can only be answered by taking into \naccount their ultimate causes. In general, emerging economies with \nhigh current account surpluse\ns as well as oil-exporting \ncountries should remove structural distortions \nthat limit the expansion \nof domestic demand. \nIn countries with an undervalued currency, for ex\nample, more flexible\n exchange rates would \nstrengthen purchasing power and thus\n help to redirect growth \nfrom exports to domestic \ndemand. This, however, is not\n a panacea and should be supp\nlemented by structural \nreforms. In China, for \nexample, such reforms might incl\nude measures to improve social", "Page 5 of 6 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nsecurity, which would reduce precautionary household saving, strengthen domestic demand \nand ultimately lead to a more balanced current account. Economies with persistently large \ncurrent account deficits, on \nthe other hand, should adopt \nmeasures to support saving. This requires a \nsizeable decline in domes\ntic absorption Œ the income levels and growth ra\ntes which prevailed before the crisis are no longer the \nappropriate benchmarks. Governments have to st\nabilise the public deficit, while households \nhave to reduce their debt which had grown rapidl\ny during the housing bubble. In addition, \nmeasures to strengthen export se\nctors, while maintaining open ma\nrkets, would also help to \nreduce current account deficits. The G20 recently made an attempt to address t\nhe problem of imbalance\ns at the political \nlevel: in September 2009 the ﬁFramework for \nstrong, sustainable and \nbalanced growthﬂ was \nlaunched. This framework includes a pledge to\n ﬁpromote more balanced current accountsﬂ. \nAs a general objective, this certainly points \nin the right direction \nand the framework could \nindeed usefully support the pr\nocess of restoring more balanc\ned global growth. It is backed \nby all the major stakeholders and is driven at\n the highest level by the G20 leaders. \nMoreover, a Mutual Assessment Process forms \npart of the framework. This process could \nprovide an opportunity for exerting peer pressu\nre among members to undertake the required structural reforms. Regarding the design of \nthe relevant supervisory mechanism some \nprogress was made during a m\neeting of the G20 \nin mid-February. Though difficult \nnegotiations still lie ahead I am confident that \nthey will eventually lead to viable results.", "Page 6 of 6 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \n4 Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, there is no question that \nthe problem of global imbalances has to be \naddressed. However, to be successful, it is e\nssential that efforts do not focus on symptoms \nbut rather are directed at the structural caus\nes of the imbalances. To be more specific, as \ncurrent accounts reflect a very\n complex set of determinants, \nany attempt to steer them \ndirectly within more or less ar\nbitrary limits would overburden the relevant authorities. Similar \nobjections apply to attempts \nto stabilise major exchange \nrates around some purported \nequilibrium target values. Such attempts \nat macroeconomic fine-tuning raise public \nexpectations that economic po\nlicy cannot live up to; rather, t\nhey risk creating new frictions \nthat require further interventions. Instead, it is\n up to the national authorities to implement the \nnecessary structural reforms to allow fo\nr a market-based and lasting reduction of \nimbalances. \n*    *    *"], "SECTION": "reden", "RECORD_ID": 623}
