Rather my \nremarks are of a more fundamental nature.   The financial market developments of the past 12 months and the \nculmination of events in the last fort\nnight have attracted a lot of interest from the general public. These events \nhave highlighted the interlinkages \nbetween the financial and the real sphere and the implications these linkages have for monetary policy.  Understanding developments on financial markets is a cornerstone for monetary policy making. This is true in normal times, and even more so in the extraordinary times we live in today. An analysis of the monetary \ntransmission process is therefore of the utmost importance for central bankers. And a thorough understanding of the ways in which financial \n\nmarket developments might influence the impact of monetary policy \nmeasures is a cornerstone of recent research efforts.   However, financial markets are also a \nvery important in\nformation pool for monetary policy decision-makers. The cu\nrrent tensions on the financial markets also complicate the task of deriving the information embedded in financial markets. In the following\n I will try to elaborate on these two \nrelated aspects Œ financial markets and monetary policy transmission, and the information content of financial markets for decision-making.    Page 2 of 12", "Embargo: 26 September 2008, 13:45 local time \n I will attempt always to relate to the experiences of the past 12 months in \norder to give real-world examples to \nillustrate the more general aspects of \nboth topics. In order to do so, I will \ngive a brief outline of the underlying \ncauses of the recent financial market tensions. \n  2 The underlying causes of the recent financial market turmoil \nWhen looking at the underlyin\ng causes of the recent tensions in the global \nfinancial system, no one particular devel\nopment can be clearly identified as the root cause. Numerous culprits have been put forward: \nsecuritisation, quality of risk management, credit rating agencies, \ncompensation schemes, accounting standards Œ to name just a few. But I am extremely sceptical of\n monocausal explanations. Instead, I believe that \na cocktail of various ingredients tr\niggered the shock waves that have \nrocked the financial system. Many of these factors are related to financial innovations or, to be more precise, from a combination of new and \ncomplex instruments to transfer credit risks and the ﬁoriginate and distributeﬂ business model.  The disruptions of the past few months have highlighted the heightened \ncomplexity of credit risk transfer (CRT) instruments. This \nwould have been \nless problematic had the risk management systems of financial intermediaries kept pace with the changing characteristics of the financial \nlandscape. However, not a\nll of them did. At the same time, the investor \nbase has become more diffuse, with \nsome participants only recently \nhaving entered the CRT markets, maybe not sufficiently familiar with the \ninstruments at hand. All of this sugges\nts that several investors may not have fully appreciated the higher-risk nature of CRT products and were \ntherefore overly optimistic in their assessments of the risks involved.  \n Securitisation activity was fostered by the ﬁoriginate and distributeﬂ model in place at large banks and securities firms. On a positive note, the \n\nsecuritising, tranching and trading of credit risks has led to a fairly broad risk dispersion Œ a feature which mo\nst market participants and observers \ndeemed to be purely positive. However, it has become clear now, that the ﬁoriginate and distributeﬂ model can ac\ntually improve the resilience of the \nfinancial system only if a \nhigh-quality standard is maintained at all levels of \nthe transfer process and no new concentrations of risk arise. The past few years, however, have been characterised by a series of distorted incentives, which has manifested itself\n in lax originat\nion standards for products such as subprime mortgages and an excessive reliance on credit \nratings by some investors. As a final point, let me add that, at the end of \nthe day, the ﬁoriginate and distributeﬂ model led Œ rather unexpectedly Œ to \na huge reintermediation of credit risks on to banks™ balance sheets; in \nsome sense, therefore, the clock is turned back.  \n Page 3 of 12", "Embargo: 26 September 2008, 13:45 local time \n In other words, the financial market turmoil has demonstrated that (1) risks disappear and that (2) removing assets from bank balance sheets does not mean that banks are no \nlonger exposed to the risks associated with \nthem. Hence, the designers of risk management systems should reconsider their view of credit guarantees and credit lines to off-balance-\n\nsheet entities such as structured inve\nstment vehicles and conduits and the \n\nreputational risk associated with them. In a nutshell, securitisation, as \nClaudio Borio aptly put it in 2008, has, ultimately, ﬁdistributed fear rather than risksﬂ. However, while financial innovation has undoubtedly increased \nvulnerabilities in the global financial system, there is more to the present \nfinancial market turmoil than the proliferation of structured finance products. The ﬁoriginate and distributeﬂ model would arguably not have \nbeen possible without the benign econom\nic and financial backdrop notably \nrobust global economic growth, low inflation, a low level of interest rates, \nlow default rates and rising asset prices \nin many countries, not just in the USA.  This Goldilocks economy, where conditions were neither ﬁtoo coldﬂ nor \nﬁtoo hotﬂ, had Œ as a side effect Œ masked the gradual build-up of financial \n\nimbalances; a development many of us\n have seen already before the turmoil. And the BIS is one very prominent example that made this very \nclear already at an early stage of the process. Hence, while lending and \nrisk-taking experienced rapid growth, words of warning from central banks \nand other institutions largely went unheeded with the argum\nent that ﬁthis \ntime, developments are surely different from the pastﬂ. The fact that minor financial market tensions in the spri\nng of 2005 and 2006 had left financial \nmarkets more or less unscathed only served to reinforce that impression. \n\nHowever, once the vulnerabilities in\n the global financial system were revealed in August last year and financial imbalances started unwinding, \nwe all witnessed that the environment had changed considerably since \nthen.  3 Recent financial market tensions: Lessons for monetary policy \nThe list of lessons to be learnt from the current financial turmoil covers many areas. I do not want to discuss \nin any detail the many proposals that \nare currently being debated in different\n national and international bodies. \nAs the G-7 finance ministers and governors have recently stated, it is \nimportant to recognise the need for mo\nre effective regulation. In that context we remain fully committ\ned to the recommendations of the Financial Stability Forum to improve \nthe resilience of the international \n\nfinancial system. While I do not deny t\nhe importance of these aspects, in \nthe following I would like to focus on an \naspect that is more related to the \ngeneral theme of today™s conference, namely the lessons to be learnt by \nmonetary policy makers in their core business of setting short-term interest \n\nrates to safeguard macroeconomic stability.  Page 4 of 12", "Embargo: 26 September 2008, 13:45 local time \n I therefore do not intend to describe t\nhe reactions of central banks to the current turmoil in terms of money market operations, but take a step back \nfrom this sort of crisis management to the more general issue of \nconducting monetary policy in the face of a procyclical behaviour of \nfinancial market participants.   In the first half of this decade, monetary policy was expansive in most \nindustrial countries. This is true of \ninterest rate based measures of the monetary policy stance, and it is also ev\nident in indicators such as money \nand credit aggregates. The expansive \nmonetary policy stance after the New Economy bubble burst has been well documented for the United \nStates. But traditional indicators also\n signal an expansionary policy stance \nfor a prolonged period of time for the euro area. At the same time, risk \npremia on financial markets have been historically low for reasons we \ncould not explain with the aid of traditional macroeconomic factors.   As there is empirical evidence that protracted low \ninterest rates may have fostered financial market participants™ grog risk appetite and contributed to the dynamic growth of \ncredit aggregates worldwide via this risk-taking \nchannel in the monetary policy transmission, the events of the past 12 \nmonths also throw up some serious questions on the role of monetary policy.  The debate about monetary policy and fi\nnancial markets is too often slanted towards the question of how to deal with asset price bubbles. \n\nHere, the current majority view is: a) monetary policy cannot and should \nnot target asset prices; b) monetary policy should not prick asset price \nbubbles; c) monetary policy should focus on limiting the fallout from \nbursting bubbles ex post.  In my opinion, this view of monetary \npolicy and asset prices is too narrow. \nA more fruitful debate on appropriate monetary policy reactions to \n\ndevelopments on financial markets would be possible if the focus were \nredirected from financial bubbles to t\nhe issue of procyclicality. Monetary policy makers should not view boom and bust episodes on the financial \n\nmarkets as unrelated events. In the medium term, the monetary policy \n\nreaction to downturns on the asset mark\nets influences mark\net participants™ \nrisk perception in the following upturn. This is especially evident where \nmonetary policy makers apply a risk management approach that \n\nasymmetrically lowers rates in times of severe financial market downturns, \nover and above what would be deemed necessary given the baseline \noutlook on prices and growth.   A more symmetric approach would treat boom and bust episodes not as \nisolated events but would try to look \nthrough the financial cycle in order to steady policy. To be more specific, a more symmetric policy would also \nrealise implicit risks in times when money and credit growth is dynamic, \n Page 5 of 12", "Embargo: 26 September 2008, 13:45 local time \n asset prices go up and risk perceptions decline, possibly creating the need to act despite sufficiently low current inflation rates.  This, however, does not mean that monetary policy should downgrade the \nprice stability objective for the sake of other objectives. Rather, it means that central banks should take a longer-term perspective which takes into \naccount the future inflationary consequences of such unfavourable \ndevelopments.   And indeed, empirical work pioneered by the BIS has found that excessive money and credit growth has significant\n leading indicator properties for sharp corrections on asset markets and severe repercussions on the rest \nof the economy. As financial crises increase the volatility of \nmacroeconomic variables such as inflation and growth, and given that \nmonetary policy operates under the traditi\nonal loss functions, these results \nindicate that a more symmetric \npolicy would improve welfare and \nmacroeconomic stability. Moreover, it could be argued that the variance of macroeconomic variables itself is not independent of the monetary policy \nstrategy chosen. A more symmetric \nmonetary policy approach to financial \ncycles therefore has an additional endogenous impact.  Given the macroeconomic relevance of \nfinancial crises, we have good \nreason to widen our monetary policy time horizon and give low-frequency \nmovements in credit and monetary aggregates more weight in our analytical frameworks and our monetary policy decision-making \nprocesses. That is not to say that such an approach would eliminate \nfinancial cycles altogether. However, in the medium to long term, a \n\nmonetary policy that followed a more symmetric course would do more to dampen damaging financial cycles than a monetary policy that merely tries \nto limit damage after the event using aggressive interest rate measures.  \n Given that the eye of the current storm is the US real estate market and that the US Federal Reserve is well \nknown for actively pursuing a risk-management approach, it comes as no surprise that most debates \ncurrently focus on US monetary policy. But given the prolonged period of \nlow interest rates in the euro area over\n the past couple of years, these \nissues must also be addressed by\n monetary policy makers in the \nEurosystem.   Here, the Eurosystem™s monetary policy strategy already possesses, in the shape of its monetary analysis, such a stabilising element, which is \n\nespecially suited for the analysis of long-term developments. The recent financial turmoil has shown that the o\nften criticised monet\nary and credit analysis has a valuable role to play in monetary policy analysis.  \n  Page 6 of 12", "Embargo: 26 September 2008, 13:45 local time \n 4 MTM and financial developments \nThe relationship between monetary poli\ncy and financial markets, however, is by no means one that is\n of interest to policy make\nrs only in the face of a \ncrisis. Developments on financial markets have the potential to modify \ncore economic relationships and are therefore of utmost interest for monetary policy. Let me therefore move away somewhat from the recent stress episode to discuss other structural issues related to financial \ninnovations and monetary policy transmission. \n The remarkable financial developments of the past decade brought with \nthem a wide range of new financial products, greater competition, a \nnotable increase in securitisation activities, disintermediation, and a \n\nconsolidation process in the banking sector. This has broadened the range of financial market participants™ activities and possibly also changed their reaction to shocks, e.g. to monetary policy innovations. A priori, the overall \nimpact of such changes caused by financial development is unclear, but \nthe empirical literature provides us with some useful hints:   Increased competition in banking toget\nher with enhanced availability of alternative capital market-based instruments for financial investment has \nlikely amplified and/or accelerated the \neffects of monetary policy changes \non bank interest rates (and, ceteris paribus, on output and inflation).  The bank lending channel is generally thought to have lost importance, \nbecause   – banks™ flexibility to react to interest rate hikes has \nincreased and –  – financial development has broadened borrowers™ financing \noptions, reducing their dependency on bank loans.  With the growing use of der\nivative instruments, banks™ lending policies might also have become less vulnerable to monetary policy tightening (e.g. Purnanandam (2007)).  The additional funding opportunities entail a larger share of market-based (rather than bank-based) products; as these are more standardised and \n\nless idiosyncratic, collateral may \nplay a more important role now, potentially increasing the importance of the balance sheet channel.  \n However, there is not much evidenc\ne for the euro area on whether and \nhow financial development has changed the overall monetary policy \n\ntransmission process in terms of output and inflation (and not just specific \ntransmission channels). We in the Bundesbank have recently taken an \n\naggregate look at the data without imposin\ng too many a priori restrictions and estimated a series of canonical VARs in order to capture the overall monetary transmission process in the euro area. More specifically, we \n Page 7 of 12", "Embargo: 26 September 2008, 13:45 local time \n have checked whether there have been notable changes to the general \nway in which monetary policy affects output and inflation. Using a data-driven search based on aggregate dat\na, we found that euro-area transmission did indeed undergo notable changes in the mid-1990s; \nspecifically, there is evidence of\n a structural break around 1996 and \npossibly a second one around 1999. Interestingly, these changes to the monetary transmission process do not seem to have altered the long-run \nresponses of real output and inflation to monetary policy: notably, long-run \nneutrality still holds, and monetary policy \nis able to control inflation in the \nlong term. But, maybe surprisingly, monetary transmission in the period \n1980-1996 is not significantly different from that in the period 1999-2006. \nWe interpret this as evidence of an ﬁatypical interim periodﬂ characterised \nby ﬁfluctuationsﬂ or ﬁperturbationsﬂ lasting from 1996 to the end of 1998. \nDuring this period, the \nmonetary transmission process in the euro area differed significantly from the periods\n before and afterwards. However, this \nresult does not necessarily mean that financial development left monetary \ntransmission unchanged: Financial development may have had offsetting effects on different transmission channels, e.g. speeding up the interest \nrate channel, lessening the importance of the bank lending channel and \nboosting the role of the balance sheet channel. Moreover, it could well be \nthat other influences were at work as \nwell, possibly mitigating the effects of financial development on the transmission process, such as the creation of \nthe euro area or, as a secular trend, globalisation.  \n To sum up: Since a good knowledge \nof the monetary transmission \nprocess is essential for monetary policy, central banks must monitor \n\ndevelopments in the financial markets closely because they have the \n\npotential to seriously affect the monetary transmission process. This \nconference adds a great deal to this issue. At the same time, the existing \n\nevidence must be ﬁprocessedﬂ in or\nder to obtain a reliable empirical assessment of possible changes to the transmission process as a whole. \nFor the time being, monetary policy has to be based on a broad range of different indicators to avoid running the risk of misreading important information.  5 Financial market indicators a\nnd monetary policy decision making \n5.1 Financial market indicator\ns as information variables for monetary policy \nThe previous section examined the possible effects of financial market \n\ndevelopments on monetary policy transmission. Although the ongoing \ndevelopment of financial markets may have induced changes in monetary \npolicy transmission, I Œ as a central banker and monetary policy decision \nmaker Œ would like to point to another link between monetary policy and \n Page 8 of 12", "Embargo: 26 September 2008, 13:45 local time \n financial market development. That is Œ as\n it were Œ the reverse causation: \nHow does financial development affe\nct (the) monetary policy decision \nmaking (process).  Important information for monetary policy decisions can undoubtedly be \nderived from financial market indicators. When considering the usual monetary policy transmission from a chang\ne in central bank interest rates \nto the ultimate monetary policy objective, information derived from \nfinancial market indicators as part of\n regular monetary policy preparations \ncan be divided into the following categories.   First, information on market expectations about interest rates, including \ncentral bank interest rates as expected monetary policy moves. E.g., we \nderive the interest rate path expected by financial markets using EONIA \nswaps. In addition to this path, we assess financial markets™ uncertainty \nsurrounding their interest rate expectations. To this end, we derive the \nrisk-neutral density from the options on the three-month Euribor future.  Second, information on financing conditions\n in the private sector (including \nrisk premia in the financial markets)\n as well as market expectations \nconcerning the development of major real economic indicators Œ such as the real interest rate, economic activity or commodity prices.  Third, information on financial markets™ expectations about future price \ndevelopments, especially as an indicator of the credibility of monetary policy and, hence, as an indicator for se\ncond round effects. Here, we use \ninformation derived from inflation-indexed bonds and inflation swaps.   All these indicators proved to be very important for assessing the current economic situation and for monetary policy decisions. Consequently, \nfinancial market are not just import\nant for the transmission of monetary \npolicy, they also supply us with important information for monetary policy \ndecisions.   Furthermore, financial development has increased the number of \n\ninstruments from which such information can be derived. However, the \nfinancial market turmoil has made an analysis of financial market \nindicators even more important Œ \nwhile at the same time making interpretation much more difficult Œ an aspect I would like to illustrate in the following section. \n 5.2 Current difficulties in interp\nreting financial market indicators 5.2.1 Interest rate expectations \nFinancial market expectations concerning \nfuture short-term interest rates \nconstitute an important input in assessing the possible impact of monetary \n Page 9 of 12", "Embargo: 26 September 2008, 13:45 local time \n policy measures on economic developm\nents. Short-term interest rate expectations derived from financial market data show whether or not a \npossible interest rate step is already priced into the financial markets. Thus, a change in key interest rates causes market interest rates to react more strongly, the more unexpected the interest rate step is. Precise \nknowledge of interest rate expectations also helps to counteract any \nundesired developments, perhaps using communication policy instruments \nto bring market interest rate expectations more into line with the central bank™s own view. E.g., the financial market™s interest rate expectations for \nthe euro area can be calculated using EONIA swaps. This exercise yields an expected interest rate path for the one-month interest rate. The key \ninterest rates expected by the financial markets can be deduced under the assumption of a fixed interest rate spread between the one-month rate \nand the minimum bid rate. Based on this expected interest rate path one \ncan, e.g., calculate the probability financial markets attach to an interest \n\nrate change of 25 base points at the next Governing Council meeting. It \nshould be clear, however, that this probability is critically dependent on the assumption of a fixed interest rate spread between the expected one-\nmonth rate and the deduced expected minimum bid rate. A one base point \nchange in the assumed spread would lead to a change \nin the probability of a 25 base point hike by 4 base points.   Given the current money market distortions, however, considerable \n\nfluctuations in the spread between \nthe one-month rate and the minimum bid rate cannot be ruled out. One reason could be tensions on the swap \n\nmarket owing to a decline in market participants™ willingness or ability to take risks. Our assessment of financial markets™ uncertainty regarding their interest rate forecast could also be distorted by the current financial market turmoil because of variations in the risk premia contained in the \nthree-month money market interest rates: In order to estimate market \nparticipants' uncertainty regarding their \ninterest rate forecast, we derive \nthe risk-neutral density from options on the three-month Euribor future. \n\nThe more certain market participants are about their point forecast on the \n\nthree-month Euribor, the smaller the standard deviation of the estimates \n\nshould be. We therefore usually interpret a change in the expected three-\nmonth Euribor distribution as indicating a change in financial markets™ expectation of Eurosystem policy rates. However, currently we cannot rule \nout the possibility that the financial ma\nrket turbulence has caused volatility \nin the risk premium which is currently\n contained in the interest rate for \nunsecuritised three-month-money (Euribo\nr). In order to obtain an answer \nto the question of what factors are driving an expected change, we \ncontinuously analyse the development of\n the Euribor-Forward three-month EONIA swap spreads. That is the difference between an implied three-\nmonth interest rate derived from Euribor rates and one derived from \nEONIA swaps. In general, this spread provides information on liquidity \npremiums for different maturities in the money market. Financial market expectations of a steady decline in money market uncertainty would imply \n Page 10 of 12", "Embargo: 26 September 2008, 13:45 local time \n not only an ongoing dr\nop in liquidity premiums but also lower premiums for \ntime periods further in the future \ncompared to less distant time spans.  5.2.2 Financial-market-based exp\nectations on important economic indicators In addition to this money-market analysis, we monitor the development of capital market-oriented measures of \nrisk premia. Assuming freedom from arbitrage in capital markets, affine term structure models can be used to \ndetermine to what extent macroeconomic factors, such as the inflation rate \n\nor potential output utilisat\nion, can explain the current term structure. \nConversely, such models show the cont\nribution of latent or undetermined factors to the current term structure. In Germany, for example, historical \ndata show that, the longer the term to maturity, the smaller the amount of interest rate variation attributable to macroeconomic factors is.1   Information about factors driving term structure is important for assessing \nwhether the yield curve is influenced by shocks to the term premium. In this case, a monetary policy impulse may affect long-term interest rates in a different way than in previous periods. This aspect has been particularly \nimportant in the recent past when it proved difficult to explain the low level \nof long-term rates in the United States despite increases in short-term \nrates. This information is particularly relevant when looking at the current \nfinancial market turbulence. On t\nhe other hand, however, the current \nturmoil complicates the derivation of the risk premia because upwardly \nﬁdistortedﬂ money market rates are usually included within the set of chosen interest rates.   5.2.3 Financial-market-based inflation expectations \nIt is extremely important for central bankers to know the level of inflation \nexpectations. They provide informati\non on what inflation rates are taken into account in wage negotiations, for example, and whether there is a risk \nthat temporary inflation shocks will le\nad to a permanent increase in the inflation rate which could not be tole\nrated by monetary policy. Long-term inflation expectations are therefore a good indicator for the credibility of \nmonetary policy.  Information on economic agents™ inflatio\nn expectations is gained mostly \nfrom surveys. Within the euro area, Consensus Economics and the ECB regularly ask for such information. The plausibility of this survey-based \n\ninformation can generally be verified using the inflation premiums \ncontained in financial market prices. To determine financial-market-based \ninflation expectations, we use the breakeven inflation curve as well as \n                                           \n 1  See ﬂThe determinants of the term stru\ncture of interest rates Œ approaches to \ncombining arbitrage-free models and monet\nary macroeconomicsﬂ, Bundesbank \nmonthly report, April 2006, pp 15-28. \n Page 11 of 12", "Embargo: 26 September 2008, 13:45 local time \n information from inflation swaps. The resulting BEIR term structure is the \ndifference between a nominal and a real interest rate curve. The latter is \nderived from the returns on inflation-linked bonds of AAA rated euro-area \ncountries. Looking at the long-term risks to price stability the \nfact that both survey-based and financial-market-based long-term inflation expectations \nare now noticeably higher than they were before the outbreak of the financial market turbulence is cause for concern.  \n Current financial-market-based indicators for inflation expectations may, \nhowever, be distorted by the turbulence. \nLike the market for interest rate \nswaps, the market for in\nflation swaps may be suffering from a smaller supply of inflation protection. While banks usually supply inflation \nprotection, a decrease in their willingness \nor their ability to take risks Œ i.e. \ngiven less room for manoeuvre in liquidity-absorbing asset swap activities \nŒ could have increased the inflation \nswap premium. This could be one \nreason why the difference in the long-term measures of inflation \nexpectations using inflation swaps and using the BEIR-curve has widened \nsubstantially over the last couple of weeks.  \n On the other hand, however, strong safe haven effects in nominal AAA-\n\nrated government bonds may have caused the term premiums of the \n\nrespective securities to shift, resulting in a downwards distortion of the \n\nBEIR curve. It is consequently not immediately clear whether long-term \ninflation expectations based on swaps or long-term inflation expectations based on the BEIR curve are currently more reliable. Our reaction to this \n\nfinding has been to increase the weight we attach to survey-based \nindicators of long-term inflation expect\nations Œ although, of course, they too have disadvantages.  6 Conclusion \nI have tried to illustrate some aspects of the close relationship between \n\nmonetary policy and financial markets. In so doing, I have tried to strike a balance between focusing on recent event\ns in financial markets and more \ngeneral aspects. Financial developments ha\nve the potential to change the \ntransmission process. Financial markets provide valuable information for decision-makers. However, during episodes of financial turmoil, the \ninformation embedded in asset prices \nis distorted and requires careful interpretation. Monetary policy should react to the financial cycle in a more \nsymmetric way in order to reduce \nlow-frequency volatility in important \nmacro variables. All these points illustrate the growing influence of \n\nfinancial market developments on monetary policy. However, they by no means alter the ultimate goals of monetary policy.  *    *    * \n Page 12 of 12"], "SECTION": "reden", "RECORD_ID": 759}
