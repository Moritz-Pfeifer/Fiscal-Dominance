Looking at the list of previ\nous speakers, I certainly feel honoured \nto contribute to what has now beco\nme established as a major forum of \ndebate on European issues. I should like to use this opportunity to discuss \nsome aspects of ongoing financ\nial integration in Europe and its \nimplications for monetary policy. Final\nly, I will touch upon some issues of \ncross-border banking integration and banking supervision in Europe. \n \nTalking about financial integration at\n a foreign bankers™ association \nharbours the risk of ﬁcarrying coals \nto Newcastleﬂ Œ managing financial \nintegration is, after all, your daily \nbusiness. But, for t\nhat reason alone, it \nmight be the right place to take stock \nof what we have achieved in Europe \nand to give you my assessment, from\n a monetary policy perspective, of \nthe successes and future challenges in this rapidly evolving field.", "Embargo:23.5.2006, 16:30 p.m. local tim\n  Page 3 of 15 \n2 Financial integration: defini\ntion, importance, and benefits Meaning, benefits, and developmen\nts of financial integration Financial integration Œ adopting a co\nmmonly used definition Œ is an \nobjective that is achieved when: (i) all potential participants in a ma\nrket for a given set of financial \ninstruments or services are subject to a single set of rules, (ii) have equal access to this se\nt of instruments and services,  (iii) and are treated equally when \nthey operate in the market.  \nFinancial integration in th\nis sense can be seen as the absence of location-\nbased discrimination in accessing the capital markets.  \n\n \nFinancial integration has, in general, tw\no main benefits: Firstly, increasing \nthe potential for higher economic gr\nowth: owing to a more efficient \nallocation of capital, financial integr\nation boosts the efficiency of the \nfinancial system. An efficient financia\nl system has a positive impact on \n(non-inflationary) economic growth, \nas the empirical evidence shows. \nSecondly, regionally diversified invest\nment alternatives lead to a better \ndiversification of risks.  \n \nIn this sense, the integration of \nfinancial markets can be considered as \nmaking a positive contribution to financial \nstability since it helps to improve \nthe capacity of economies to absorb s\nhocks. It is thus clear that fostering \nfinancial integration is of major \nrelevance for general economic and \nspecific monetary policy reasons.  \n\n \nThese benefits of integrated financial \nmarkets are the main reason for the \nglobal phenomenon of rapidl\ny growing cross-border \nlinkages of financial \nassets and liabilities. On a globa\nl scale, financial integration has \naccelerated over the past ten to 15 \nyears: In industrial countries, the \naverage of foreign assets and liabilities\n to GDP has tripled since the mid-", "Embargo:23.5.2006, 16:30 p.m. local tim\n  Page 4 of 15 \n1990s. A similar process can be observed in emerging markets, although \nthe cross-border linkages start at lower levels.  Main drivers of financial integration? \nIn general, three drivers of financial in\ntegration can be id\nentified: market \nforces, collective action, and pub\nlic action. These reflect the \ncomplementary role of private and public sector action in this process.  \nMarket forces are the natural origin of\n financial integrati\non, mainly through \neconomies of scale and scope as we\nll as technological progress. \nCollective and public action comes into\n play when market forces alone are \nincapable of removing inefficienc\nies Œ on account of ﬁnetwork \nexternalitiesﬂ, for example. The existence of netwo\nrk externalities has two \nimplications: Firstly, national financ\nial infrastructures have developed individually over a period of decades. \nChanging these structures is often \nassociated with switching costs Œ at \nleast in the short run. Secondly, \nhowever, in the long run the positive \nexternalities of integrated financial \nmarkets outweigh the costs of s\nwitching from one institutional \narrangement to another, so collective or\n public action may be necessary to \nachieve more efficient outcomes. \n \nMoreover, frequently collective action is crisis-driven Œ which reflects a \n\nsomewhat pathological learning on \nthe part of market participants. \nExamples of this are collective ac\ntion clauses in international bond \ncontracts or the growing \nimportance of standards \nand codes of conduct in \nthe aftermath of the Asian financial cris\nis (for instance, core principles of \nbanking supervision). In this way, public\n authorities can play a role as a \ncatalyst or a facilitator of collective \naction as well as bei\nng an originator of \nlegislative or regul\natory frameworks.  \nWhile not denying the impor\ntance of market driv\nen developments in the \nprocess of financial integr\nation, we should not forget that what lies behind", "Embargo:23.5.2006, 16:30 p.m. local tim\n  Page 5 of 15 \nthe latest wave of integration is the \ndeliberate political dec\nision to liberalise \nthe cross-border movement of capital.\n This is true not only of emerging \nmarkets but also of countries in Eu\nrope. Economists usually explain the \nconceptual background to these difficult\n policy choices as solutions to the \nmacroeconomic ﬁtrilemmaﬂ of striki\nng the right balance between freedom \nof capital movements, monetary pol\nicy autonomy, and the exchange rate \nregime. \n \nEuropean monetary union is a cornerst\none solution to this trilemma. \nElimination of national monetary po\nlicy, irrevocable fixing of the \nparticipating exchange rates, and t\nhe introduction of a new currency in \norder to reap the benefits of integrat\ned financial markets in Europe. Thus, \nEMU is both the European response to gl\nobalisation and at the same time \nthe most important stimul\nus to European financial market integration in \nhistory. \n 3 What is the current state of \nfinancial integration in Europe? \nThe current degree of financial int\negration in Europe varies between \nmarket segments. A simple, but useful\n quantitative measure of financial \nintegration is to check the \nvalidity of the law \nof one price. It states that in a \nfully integrated market risk-adjusted pric\nes should be equal irrespective of \nthe place of transaction.  \n \nMoney markets \nNearly full integration in this \nsense has been achieved in the money \nmarket. This comes as no surprise as it\n is a prerequisite for the functioning \nof the single monetary policy. The \nintegration of t\nhe euro area money market has been supported by devel\nopments in the payment systems \ninfrastructure, most notably the es\ntablishment of the Trans-European \nAutomated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) \nsystem. TARGET allows the smooth f\nunctioning of the settlement of large-", "Embargo:23.5.2006, 16:30 p.m. local tim\n  Page 6 of 15 \nvalue cross-border payments. This also\n shows that one important field of \nfinancial integration, other \nthan markets, is infrastructure. Although it is of \nmajor relevance in the current Europe\nan context, I will not go into this \nissue in greater depth here. \n \nThe unsecured segment of the money\n market was already almost \nperfectly integrated when monetary\n union was launched. The cross-\ncountry standard deviation of the aver\nage overnight lendi\nng rates among \neuro area countries fell from more t\nhan 100 base points at the beginning \nof 1998 to 3 base points at the beginn\ning of 1999. This measure is now \nmoving around 1 base point. \n \nAlmost perfect integration has also \nbeen established on \nthe repo market. \nThe EUREPO index has shown cro\nss-country standard deviations below 1.5 base points and below 2.5 base poi\nnts for the one-month and the 12-month maturities, respectively, since its launch in March 2002. Another \n\nexample of a perfectly integrated mark\net is the overnight interest rate \nswap market, given a perfectly standardised product definition.   \nThe less integrated money market s\negments are, accordingly, those \nwhere standardisation is\n underdeveloped and fragmen\ntation persists. In \nparticular, the short-term securities \nmarket is still segmented in several \nmarket places, but the Short-Term Eu\nropean Paper (STEP) initiative, led \nby the ACI (Financial Markets A\nssociation) and supported by the \nEurosystem, is expected to reduce the current fragmentation. \n\n Bond markets Government bonds The bond markets are nearly as integrat\ned as the money markets. This is \nlargely due to the elimination of ex\nchange rate risks and the convergence \nof inflation expectations across t\nhe euro area. The standard deviations of \ngovernment bond yield spreads have declined from figures above", "Embargo:23.5.2006, 16:30 p.m. local tim\n  Page 7 of 15 \n200 base points in the mid-1990s to cl\nose to zero. It should be borne in \nmind, however, that, owing to differenc\nes in credit risk, government bonds \nwill never be perfectly hom\nogenous products. But there is, of course, no \ncontradiction between financial in\ntegration and country-risk-adjusted \npricing. \n Corporate bonds This is equally relevant to the pric\ning of corporate bond\ns as it depends on \na large number of influenc\ning factors Œ the country \nof issuance being just \none possible factor amongst others. Enc\nouragingly, econometric studies of \nthe corporate bond market show that \nthe yield spreads have no systematic \ncountry component. The corporate bond market is thus also fairly \n\nintegrated. \n \nMoreover, the European corporate bond market has witnessed \nexceptional growth since 1999 which has\n not been restricted to traditional \nfinancial instruments, but \nalso includes alternative and innovative financing \nsuch as mezzanine capital and credit derivatives. \n Equity markets \nIn contrast to money and bond markets,\n and in spite of th\ne fact that ﬁhome \nbiasﬂ in the equity holdings of in\nstitutional investors has been reduced \nmarkedly, the equity markets of t\nhe euro area are still much more \nfragmented. For example, the propor\ntion of foreign stock and bond \nholdings of German investment funds\n increased from 15% in the mid-\n1990s to more than 50% after 1999.\n Notwithstanding increasingly \nhomogenous reactions of stock prices \nto euro-area-wide factors and news, \nparticularly from monetary policy, c\nountry effects still have an important \nexplanatory role for the variance of equity returns.", "Embargo:23.5.2006, 16:30 p.m. local tim\n  Page 8 of 15 \nBanking As regards the integration of the Eu\nropean banking markets, there has \nbeen some progress, but furt\nher integration is still des\nirable. The degree of \nintegration varies across the vari\nous segments of banking business. \nCross-border activities have increas\ned significantly in inter-bank and \nwholesale business. The share of \nsecurities issued by non-monetary \nfinancial institutions of\n another euro area country \nwhich are held by euro \narea monetary financial institutions has more than doubled since 1997. Euro area cross-border loans between monetary financial institutions have increased from 15% of all loans among EU MFIs in 1997 to currently 23%. \n \nWhat is disappointing from my point\n of view is th\ne small degree of integration achieved so far in the \nretail banking segment. The share of euro area cross-border MFI loans grant\ned to non-MFI™s has risen from 2% \nof total loans in 1997 to 3.\n5% at present, which is st\nill a very low level. The \ncross-country standard deviation of MFI \ninterest rates on consumer credits \nhas been fluctuating betw\neen 80 and 100 base points in\n recent years, and \nthe corresponding figure for house purchase credits has varied between \n\n40 and 60 base points. \n\n \nAccordingly, one of the five prio\nrities contained in the European \nCommission White Paper on EU financial \nservices policy for the next five \nyears is the creation of more com\npetition between service providers, \nespecially those active in retail markets. \n 4 Financial system developments: \nﬁbank-basedﬂ versus ﬁcapital-market-basedﬂ systems Financial markets integration implie\ns the transformation of national \nfinancial systems. Textbooks typicall\ny distinguish between two types of \nfinancial systems: bank-based syst\nems and capital-market-based \nsystems. Classical stereotypes of th\nis dichotomy are the European bank-", "Embargo:23.5.2006, 16:30 p.m. local tim\n  Page 9 of 15 \nbased system and the US financial system\n, which is dominated by capital \nmarkets.   \nActually, the reality in Eu\nrope is more like a conti\nnuum of characteristics. \nComparing the countries of the Eu\nropean Union, one can see that \ndomestic bank credits in relation to GDP vary markedly across \n\nEU countries. And Germany, often regar\nded as the archetypal bank-based \nfinancial system, has a credit-to-GDP \nratio that does not significantly \nexceed the EU(-25) average. The Net\nherlands has the largest proportion \nof domestic credits to GDP (almost 180%). \n \nDespite some variability from count\nry to country, the euro area™s stock \nmarket capitalisation of nearly 70% is \nstill well below t\nhat of the US and \nthe UK (2004). The UK™s stock market capitalisation was more than 127% \n\nof its national GDP in 2004. The corre\nsponding figure for the US stock \nmarkets was nearly 140% of GDP in \n2004. But the importance of capital \nmarkets in the euro area is growi\nng continuously. For comparison: euro \narea stock market capitalisation in re\nlation to GDP was 19% on average in \n1990-94. It grew to 50% in 2000-\n2004 (US: 1990-94: 69%, 2000-2004: \n132%). \n \nAccordingly, there is a significant\n trend in Europe towards financial \nsystems that are more capital-market\n-based, but the disintermediation \neffects of this gradual shift towards \na greater capital market orientation \nhave not been as strong in Europe as t\nhey have been in the US. While it is \ntrue that the share \nof bank deposits in households\n™ financial assets is on a \ndeclining trend in the euro ar\nea, the ratio of bank deposits to GDP is still \ngrowing in contrast to the development\ns in the US over the past 15 years. \nIn addition, the ratio of credit to GDP \nin the euro area has Œ from a higher \nbase level than in the US Œ increased even more markedly than on the \n\nother side of the Atlantic. So, while \nshifts towards a more market-based \nfinancial system are clear\nly under way, continen\ntal Europe and the euro", "Embargo:23.5.2006, 16:30 p.m. local tim\n  Page 10 of 15 \narea, in particular, have Œ and will \nretain Œ a bank-dominated financial \nsystem for the foreseeable future. \n \nIn this mostly market-driven proce\nss of gradual system transformation, the \ncharacteristics of bank-based systems will lose some of their importance in \nthe euro area in the years ahead. Most not\nably, relationship lending will be \naffected. Relationship l\nending has two possible major positive effects: \nreducing debtor moral hazard and smoothing\n interest rates. In contrast to \ndirect capital market financing or \narm™s-length banking, customers that \nhave a close and long-term relationship with their bank (\nHausbank), have \ngreater incentives to preserve mutual\n trust. Borrowers know that defaulting \non a credit provided by a relationship le\nnder would finish the relationship. \nThus, relationship lending might prev\nent borrowers™ moral hazard in terms \nof inefficiently risky projects. \nHausbanks usually have more detailed and \ntimelier information on a firm than a comparable arm™s-length bank or the \ncapital market. Such a close and long-term relationship as well as better \n\nknowledge of the firms assist interest rate smoothing.  5 Implications for monetary policy  \nAnd this is where monetary policy ent\ners the scene. If capital-market-\nbased financing becomes more important in relative terms, it will have an \n\nimpact on the pass-through of monetary pol\nicy changes. In general, it can \nbe said that, other things being equal\n, the higher the degree of financial \nintegration is, the faster will be \nthe transmission process of monetary \npolicy. \n \nA further implication of the trend to\nwards capital-market-based financing is \nthe growing importance of asset prices. The Eurosystem does not target \nasset prices. The primary objective is to\n maintain price stability in the euro \narea (HICP inflation below but close to \n2% in the medium term). However, \nthe Eurosystem monitors asset pric\ne dynamics closely, because strong", "Embargo:23.5.2006, 16:30 p.m. local tim\n  Page 11 of 15 \nappreciation and subsequent rapid reversals in asset prices are \nassociated with potentia\nlly high costs for the economy and thus for price \nstability. \n \nMoreover, the increasing importance of the capital market does not just \nhave an impact on the transmission mec\nhanism and the role of asset \nprices. Extracting signals regarding risks to price stability stemming from \nmonetary developments becomes a mo\nre challenging ta\nsk. One example \nof this is the enhanced short-r\nun monetary dynamics between 2001 and \n2003 due to exceptional economic, financ\nial and geopolitical uncertainties \nthat led to portfolio shifts from capi\ntal markets to money markets bloating \nthe monetary aggregates and their growth rates.  \nFinally, more integrated financial market\ns and asset prices affect financial \nstability, too. A growing \nimportance of capital market instruments allows \nbanks to spread risks more evenly, thus \nmaking a positive contribution to \nfinancial stability. On the other hand,\n rapidly developing risk spreading \ntools like Collateralised Debt Obligat\nions (CDOs) or \ncredit derivatives \nnecessitate a more ambitious monito\nring from financial \nstability authorities in order to evaluate the effective \ndistribution of risks among financial \ninstitutions and markets. 6 European banking markets and banking supervision \nAs I mentioned earlier, the Eur\nopean financial systems remain bank-\ndominated. At the same time, European \nbanking market activities are still \nnot integrated to a great extent, mo\nst notably in the retail segment. \nNotwithstanding this, the \nongoing pressures of comp\netition and integration in the common market and EMU will ce\nrtainly shape the future banking \nlandscape in the euro area.  \n \nAnd it is not only EMU that is res\nponsible for these developments. Other \nregulatory steps are also exerting pr\nessures. Well-known examples are", "Embargo:23.5.2006, 16:30 p.m. local tim\n  Page 12 of 15 \nthe forthcoming revision of internat\nional capital adequacy rules Œ Basel II Œ \nand, in terms of the EU, the Capita\nl Requirements Directive (CRD). CRD \noffers banks incentives to be more proactive in improving risk \n\nmanagement techniques and customer se\nlection, and it \nis expected to \nhave a profound impact on t\nhe strategies of Eur\nopean banks and global \ncompetition. \n\n \nIn this context, a broad trend towards \nmore international and European \nstructures and a greater capital market\n orientation will \nhave implications \nnot only for the institutions involved but\n also for the public authorities. The \npossible consequences for monetary \npolicy of a more market-based \nfinancial system have been already ment\nioned. The emergence of cross-\nborder banking structures, on the \nother hand, also creates major \nchallenges for supervisory bodies. \n\n \nDespite the somewhat disappointing \nstate of banking integration in \ngeneral, the common market and EMU ha\nve already initiated perceptible \ncross-border M&A activities. While it \nis true that overall M&As in the \nEuropean banking se\nctor have been declining si\nnce the cyclical peak at \nthe end of the 1990s, the relative im\nportance of cross-border deals within \nthe EU has increased steadily over \nthe past 15 years (EU cross-border M&A in relation to domestic M&\nA: 1990-1994: 23.5%; \n1995-1999: 31.6%; \n2000-2004: 42.4%). \n\n \nAlthough we have witnessed an increas\ning proportion of cross-border \nM&A activities in the EU banking sector\n since the introduction of the euro, \nthere is still a lack of pan-European ban\nks. Consolidation in the banking \nsector is mostly domestic. The pres\nence of pan-European\n banking groups™ \nbranches or subsidiaries in the EU count\nries is quite limited Œ even if there \nis a lot of representation of it in th\nis conference room today. The average \nshare of foreign branches and subs\nidiaries accounts for approximately \n25% of the EU banking market. Higher figures can be found in some", "Embargo:23.5.2006, 16:30 p.m. local tim\n  Page 13 of 15 \nsmaller countries, such as the Benelux\n, and very high figures in many new \nmember states with the market shar\ne of foreign-owned banks exceeding \n95% in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Estonia and Lithuania. \n \nThe lack of retail market integration in\n banking, of course, reflects to some \nextent the fact that re\ntail banking is a local busi\nness where proximity to clients and knowledge of cultural attit\nudes is of special importance. But it \nmight also mirror possible impedim\nents to cross-border M&As. It is \nsometimes argued that the superviso\nry environment poses such an \nimpediment. And some experiences over the past couple of months have \n\ncertainly not dampened such fears.  \n \nIn general, public policy should not \ninterfere with market-driven cross-border merger processes but remove \npotential supervisory obstacles. And, \nsomewhat encouragingly, according \nto a recent (CEBS) survey of \nEuropean banks. the current supervi\nsory framework is not really \nsubstantially hindering European cross-border banking consolidation.   \nIt is clear, however, that the current st\nate of play poses a number of real \nchallenges for banking supervisors. Firs\ntly, as long as we do not see pan-\nEuropean banks on a larger\n scale, there is no justification for a pan-\nEuropean supervisory body or what \nis known as a ﬁlead supervisorﬂ. \nSecondly, emerging cross-border structures mean \nthat the legitimate \ninterests of home and host country \nsupervisory authorities have to be \nbalanced without burdening the involved banks too heavily with \n\nbureaucratic costs. \n \nIn striking that balance, convergenc\ne and cooperation in supervisory \npractices are inevitable. And further \nharmonisation of supervisory rules in \nEurope may be required to ease the cr\noss-border activities of credit \ninstitutions. And there is indeed a lo\nt of work going on in the relevant \ninstitutions, such as CEBS or BSC. Some examples may justify this claim:", "Embargo:23.5.2006, 16:30 p.m. local tim\n  Page 14 of 15 \n (i) The implementation of the CR\nD, which I have mentioned, will \nstrengthen the ties between home \nand host country supervisors \nand foster the coordinating role of home-country supervisors. (ii) The European Commission has \nlaunched an initiative to \neliminate existing barriers to cross-border mergers with \nconsequences for the supervisory approval process as well as \n\nhome and host-country interactions.  (iii) Finally, reflecting the need for timely cooperation between \nseveral players in times of\n stress, a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding involving bankin\ng supervisors, central banks, \nand finance ministries in the EU was signed in 2005.  \n The details of some of these plans\n are not uncontroversial and will need \nfurther clarification, but the overarch\ning goal is unequivo\ncally positive: to \nimprove the functioning of European cr\noss-border banking markets. Some \nof you may still argue that \nthe current institutional\n setting is too complex \nand burdensome. But, given the curr\nent European bankin\ng landscape, it \nis, in my view, an appropriate institut\nional configuration.\n Nevertheless, it \nclearly has to be constantly adapted to changes in the markets:  \n \nThe guiding principle should be that the structure of banking supervision follows the market structures. It should neither lead them nor lag behind them.  7  Concluding remarks \nLet me conclude by summarising the main\n points. Financial integration is a \nmostly beneficial process which is driv\nen by market forces as well as \ncollective action and public action. The cu\nrrent state of financial integration \nvaries across the various market s\negments, with integr\nation being most \nadvanced in those areas where the rele\nvant market is closest to the \ncommon monetary policy. Thus, a large \nmeasure of integration has been", "Embargo:23.5.2006, 16:30 p.m. local tim\n  Page 15 of 15 \nachieved on the money market and t\nhe bond markets. A lower degree of \nintegration has been achieved on t\nhe equity markets and the banking \nmarkets. European cross-border banking \nis still underdeveloped; there is \nstill a lack of pan-European banks. \n\n \nThe banking business itself is under \nthe pressure of a general trend \ntowards a more market-based financia\nl system, but the financial systems \nof the euro area countries will ce\nrtainly stay bank-oriented for the \nforeseeable future. Loans will remain t\nhe dominant financial instrument for \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises, but capital market products will gain \na more important supplementary role \nin corporate finance. Even those \nenterprises with no access to capital markets will be affected indirectly \n\nowing to the emergence of credit risk securitisation and credit derivatives. Banks will become knowledge provi\nders in the increasingly complex \nsecurities and financial markets. In \nsuch a symbiosis with the capital \nmarket, even relationship banking \nmight gain new attractiveness.  \nAs regards the monetary policy implicat\nions of this process, it may be \nexpected that the bank le\nnding channel will have a di\nminishing role in the \ntransmission process in favour of the \ninterest channel, that asset prices \nwill have a growing impact, and that there will be a more challenging \ninterpretation of monetary developments.  \n \nFinally, banking supervision must\n not impede European cross-border \nbanking consolidation. The current \ncooperation-based supervisory system \nin Europe is more appropriate at the cu\nrrent juncture than more advanced \nconcepts such as a ﬁlead supervisorﬂ or even a ﬁcentral supervisorﬂ.  \n*    *    *"], "SECTION": "reden", "RECORD_ID": 839}
