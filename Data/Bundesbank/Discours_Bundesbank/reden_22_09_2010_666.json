It is a pleas\nure to be here, and I am looking forward to discussing the problem of ma\ncroeconomic imbalances in European Monetary \nUnion (EMU) with you. Intra-EMU divergencies \nand the resulting imba\nlances in current \naccount positions are not a new\n phenomenon. In fact, they have \nexisted since the beginning of the monetary union. However, \nin the pre-crisis years the associated problems were partly \nmasked by strong global economic expansion and \nthe continuing integr\nation within the euro area. It was the financial crisis that revealed \nthe structural nature of the divergencies, and \nthey are now a prominent and controversial issue in public debate. In my speech, I would like to provide a brie\nf overview of the causes of the intra-EMU \ndivergencies and imbalances. Havi\nng laid the groundwork, I woul\nd then like to discuss what \npolicy options we have in dealing with the imbalances.", "Page 3 of 7  Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany  \nwww.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \n2 Causes of macroeconomic imbalances in EMU \n2.1 Diverging current accounts are not per se a problem – \nThe public debate on diver\ngencies within EMU focuses on the \ncurrent account positions of \nmember states; let us take a look at them \nfirst. Some member states such as Germany, \nAustria or the Netherlands have \npersistent current account surp\nluses. Other countries such \nas Portugal, Spain, Greece or Ir\neland show persistent current acc\nount deficits. In principle, a \ncurrent account surplus or deficit reflects savi\nng or borrowing at the national level. And, as \nfor individuals, there is no reason why econom\nies as a whole should not save or borrow. \nConsequently, there is no reason for current accounts to be balanced in equilibrium. \nA current account surplus or deficit reflec\nts a discrepancy between domestic savings and \ninvestment. Such a discrepancy is not necessa\nrily a bad thing. Consider the following \nexamples: countries with an agei\nng population usually save more\n than they invest as they \nface declining domestic investment opportuniti\nes. Hence, they have temporary current \naccount surpluses. At the same time, c\nountries that are catching up on economic \ndevelopment usually invest more than they\n save as they have ample investment \nopportunities but are usually shor\nt of capital. As a consequence,\n they run temporary current \naccount deficits. The common feat\nure in both these cases is that\n the current account serves \nto smooth consumption over time, and thereby \nraising welfare. Thus\n, it has an inherent \nintertemporal dimension. As a result of the relationships I have just\n sketched, capital flows from countries with \nrelatively large savings to countries with rela\ntively high investment. In EMU this flow of \ncapital was increased by the intr\noduction of the euro. There were\n two reasons for this. First,", "Page 4 of 7  Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany  \nwww.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nexchange rate risk was eliminated, making cr\noss-border investments less risky. Second, \ncountry default risks were increasingly perceiv\ned as converging towards a relatively low \nlevel. According to theory, t\nhe intra-EMU capital flows should reverse once investments in \ndeficit countries start to pay off. However, in\n reality, diverging cu\nrrent account positions \nmight also reflect underlying distorti\nons Œ this was the case in EMU. 2.2 – but proved problematic in EMU  \nThe main problem for member states with curr\nent account deficits was \nthat the inflow of \ncapital was not always allocated efficiently. In\n Spain and Ireland it w\nent into booming real \nestate markets, in Greece it funded high gove\nrnment deficits and in \nPortugal it supported \nprivate consumption. This allocation spurred in\nternal demand and, owing to inflexible labour \nmarkets, wages increased more than productivit\ny. This, in turn, reduced the competitiveness \nof the countries in question. As a consequence, imports increased, exports dwindled and the current account deficit grew further. Although these imbalances have dom\nestic roots, the associated\n problems are not confined \nto the national level. Given spill-over effect\ns in the closely integr\nated euro-area financial markets, they are also a problem for other \nmember states and for the monetary union as a \nwhole. The debt crisis in the first half of this \nyear was a case in point. Its external effects \nmean the problem of divergenc\nies and imbalances in EMU has to be solved. What are the \npolicy options?", "Page 5 of 7  Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany  \nwww.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \n3 Policy options \nA major dispute regarding policy options is t\nhe question of which group of countries has to \nadjust. In an asymmetrical approach only the def\nicit countries would ac\nt while a symmetrical approach would require economic policy in both deficit and su\nrplus countries to adjust. As I \njust argued, the deeper causes \nof the imbalances are domestic\n factors within the deficit \ncountries. Hence, it is mainly incumbent on them\n to act. A number of structural reforms are \nnecessary to enhance the competitiveness \nof domestic companies by increasing \nproductivity and keeping costs in check. At the \nsame time, the defici\nt countries have to \nincrease labour market flexibil\nity and consolidate government budget\ns. In the end, domestic \nabsorption will have to return to a sustainable level. Proponents of a symmetrical approach say that su\nrplus countries must also act. They claim \nthat these countries have \nto boost domestic demand and, c\nonsequently, imports by using \nfiscal policy stimulus. It is also argued that \nsurplus countries should raise wages, which \nwould further increase domestic demand \nand at the same time reduce their \ncompetitiveness. However, when taking a cl\noser look at these \nproposals, it becomes \napparent that they are based on invalid assumptions. To demand measures that woul\nd boost imports neglects the fact\n that trade flows are highly \ndiversified. Given the current \ntrade structure, an increase in\n German imports by 10% would \nimprove the current account \nbalance in Spain, Portugal \nand Greece by a mere 0.25 \npercentage point. The current account balance\n in Ireland would improve by 1 percentage \npoint. The proposal of raising wages to support domestic demand and reduce \ncompetitiveness does not only negl\nect that wages are not a po\nlitical control variable. \nMoreover, simulation studies show that the effe\ncts would be confined almost entirely to the", "Page 6 of 7  Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany  \nwww.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nhome economy in the form of \nchanges in employment. Finally\n, the argument that fiscal \npolicy should be used to stimulate internal\n demand and imports over\nlooks the fact that \npublic finances in surplus countries are also st\nrained and that ambitious\n consolidation efforts \nare required in these economies as well to restore the sustainability of public budgets. \nWhen looking at the internationa\nl discussion, we must also bear in mind that the current \naccount surpluses of China and, for instance, \nGermany are of a different nature Œ Germany \ndoes not manage its exchange rate \nnor does it impose capital cont\nrols. Nevertheless, what I \njust said does not imply that \nthere is no need for reforms in surplus countries. Germany, for \nexample, would benefit \nfrom more flexible labour mark\nets and deregulated services and \nproduct markets. Improvements to the educati\non system would also raise the economic \npotential. But these measures will not ease the need for adjustment in deficit countries. 4 Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, let me summarise my s\npeech. The large current\n account imbalances \nin EMU are mainly due to structural domesti\nc imbalances in deficit countries. Given spill-\nover effects in integrated euro-area financial mark\nets, the imbalances are \na serious strain on \nthe monetary union as a whole. They must therefore be corrected. The relevant reform agenda has to centre on def\nicit countries. They will have to align \ndemand and potential output more \nclosely and, at the same time, consolidate government \nbudgets. Compensatory measures by surplus \ncountries would neit\nher adequately address \nthe problem nor would they bring notable relief to deficit economies.", "Page 7 of 7  Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany  \nwww.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nWhat can European policymakers contribute? In \nthe long run, procedures to ensure fiscal \npolicy commitment will have to be strengthened, \nfor example by enhancing the Stability and \nGrowth Pact. More effective macroeconomic su\nrveillance and the development of a crisis \nresolution mechanism would, at least in\n the medium term, also be helpful.
