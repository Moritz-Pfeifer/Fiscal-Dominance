Introduction\n Dear John Hurley, Dear Dr Ken Whitaker, Ladies and gentlemen, \nThank you very much for your kind invitation \nto Dublin. I am very pleased to have this \nopportunity to share my views with you. And \nI am honoured to give this year™s Whitaker \nlecture. Ken Whitaker has b\neen the intellectual mastermi\nnd behind the theoretical and \npractical sea change in Irish economic policie\ns in general. Especially with his book on \neconomic development in 1958. \nAnd let me mention that his \nrigorous arguments against \nprotectionism and isolation and for macroeconomic \nstability are still relevant today despite \nall the achievements we have made in this respect in Europe over the past few decades.   Ken Whitaker has not only made a crucial contri\nbution to the intellectual\n foundations of solid \nmacroeconomic policies in Ireland, also he has\n not shied away from the more onerous \nchallenge of implementing his vi\news in day-to-day policy, not \nleast during his term as Irish \ncentral bank governor from 1969 to 1976.   Ken Whitaker™s tenure as central \nbank governor fell at the time \nof the first oil price shock. \nThis is a subject that is \nonce again high on t\nhe agenda of monetary po\nlicymakers all over \nthe world and it is the topic I shall focus on in my following remarks.   The world is, indeed, once again \nfacing a substantial rise in \noil prices. Prices have nearly \ntripled since mid-2003 and have now reached no\nminal record levels\n (USD70 per barrel \nBrent crude on a monthly aver\nage in April 2006). Putting it ev\nen more starkly: Taking the \nlow-point of oil prices at \nthe end of 1998 (USD10 per barrel Brent) and thus interpreting the", "Page 3 of 17\n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \ndevelopments since then as a single prolonged oi\nl price shock, the scale of the shock is \ngreatly magnified. Moreover, the cu\nrrent oil price level is perceived to be persistent, as is \nreflected by Brent crude oil futures remaining at elevated levels.   These developments are creating imminent upside ri\nsks to price stability. Consequently oil \nprices figure prominently on the risk agenda \nof the ECB™s Governing Council. This is \ndocumented by last week™s assessment that in\nflationary risks persist and continue to lie on \nthe upside. Upside risks for future price stab\nility arise, amongst other\ns, from additional \nincreases in administered prices \nand indirect taxes, and from a \nsituation with ample liquidity. \nBut in particular they stem fr\nom possible further increases \nin oil prices, a stronger pass-\nthrough of higher oil prices into\n consumer prices due to stronger\n indirect effects or possible \nsecond-round effects. I will come back to \nthese transmission channels later on.  \n As I have said before, the concer\nn about oil prices will \nbe familiar to Dr Whitaker. In his time \nas Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, \nhe had to manage the first oil price crisis of \n1973-74, the textbook exam\nple of a supply shock. It caus\ned a serious stagflation (in other words, a period characterised by both rising in\nflation and recession) \nin the oil-importing \neconomies.  \n In my subsequent remarks, I should like to c\noncentrate on the follo\nwing three issues. How \ndoes the current oil price shock compare to pr\nevious ones? Why do supply shocks pose a \nchallenge for the monetary policym\naker? What are the implicati\nons of the current high oil \nprices for the Eurosystem™s monetary policy stance? \n2. Comparison of current and previous oil price shocks", "Page 4 of 17\n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nTaking the developments since mid-2003 as a singl\ne energy price shock, the current oil \nprice hike is roughly comparable to its \npredecessors in the 1970s and 1980s. From \nDecember 1973 to January \n1974, the dollar price of oil increased by over\n 250%. Taking the \naverage oil price over the years 1974 and 1975, \nthe price hike amounted to over 160%. \nAgain, from November 1978 to \nJune 1979, the price increase was nearly 160%. Taking the \noil price high in Nove\nmber 1979, the price jumped by r\noughly 180% within one year. And it also is comparable to the oi\nl price increase in 1990 following \nthe invasion of Kuwait (from \nJune 1990 to October 1990: 140% in\n nominal US dollar terms). \nFrom the end of 1998 to the \nend of 2000, the oil pric\ne went up by more than 200%, stabi\nlising thereafter for some years \nonly to start rising again to unprecedented nominal levels since mid-2003.   \nThe scale of current oil price \ndevelopments is also comparable \nto its predecessors in real \nterms and after taking into account exchange rates -with the possible exception of the period from 1998 to 2000, when the deprecia\ntion of the euro amplified the \ndollar increase in energy \nprices. Here, however, due account should also \nbe taken of the extrem\nely low level of oil \nprices in 1998 at the onset of the price increases (under USD10 per barrel Brent).   \nIn marked contrast to its predecessors in \nthe 1970s and 1980s and in 1990, however, the \nimpact of the latest oil price shocks on real\n GDP growth have been benign. Whereas the oil \nprice shocks of the 1970s, 1980\ns and the shock in 1990 were\n accompanied by a severe \nslowdown in global growth and\n outright recessions in many \noil-importing countries, the current oil price increases are \ncoinciding with the most fav\nourable scenario for the global \neconomy in the past 35 years. Global\n GDP growth is estimated by\n the IMF at 4.8% in 2005, \ncompared with 5.3% in 2004 (h\nistorical average: 3½%). And \nreal growth in advanced \neconomies in 2004/05 was above the long-term \naverage and, according to the latest IMF \noutlook, is projected to stay at\n around 3% this year and next \nyear. Although the euro area is \nlagging behind, there are clear signs of a more sustained recovery in the quarters ahead.", "Page 5 of 17\n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \n This marked difference is also supported by simple correlation analysis: The \n\ncontemporaneous correlation between the level \nof annual oil prices\n and annual global \ngrowth was -0.6 for the \nperiod 1970-1991. For the peri\nod 1992 -2005, however, the \ncorrelation coefficient has changed radically (+\n0.6). This admittedly crude line of reasoning \nis supported by more formal country-specific econometric analysis.1 Equally remarkable is the behaviour\n of consumer price inflatio\nn in the current energy-price-\ndriven economic environment. W\nhereas the oil price shocks \nof the 1970s and 1980s went \nhand in hand globally with \nmore or less a doubling \nof inflation rates, the latest oil price \nincreases to date have not led to\n an escalation of consumer prices. On the contrary: The \npresent global inflation rates ar\ne the lowest for 35 years. In t\nhe euro area, inflation rates in \nthe aftermath of the oil pr\nice shocks edged up markedly in \nthe 1970s and 1980s and went \ninto double-digit figures. Euro area inflat\nion rates since 1999 have been much more \ncontained.  \n In light of such evidence: Is the expression ‚oil \nprice shock™ old hat? Or, as David Walton of \nthe Bank of England put it some weeks ago: ﬁHas oil lost its capacity to shock?ﬂ2   There are several plausible explanations for the muted impact of oil price increases in recent times. To start with, the diffe\nrence in today™s economic per\nformance and that of earlier \nperiods might, in part, be related to the different size and nature of the shock.                                              \n 1 For example, Jimenez-Rodriguez and Sanchez (2004) for the main OECD members; Schmidt and \nZimmermann (2005) or the German Council of Economic\n Experts (2004) for an analysis of oil price effects \non the German economy. The declining economic impac\nt of oil price increases over time has led some \nresearchers to study these issu\nes in a non-linear framework. \n2 Walton (2006).", "Page 6 of 17\n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nThe more than doubling in oil prices Œ though com\nparable in scale to ea\nrlier oil price shocks Œ has taken more than two years to unfold, much longer than on previous occasions.  \n Moreover, unlike its predecessors, the present \nprice hike is explai\nned by substantially \ndifferent factors. Shocks in the 1970s were caus\ned mainly by sizeable disruptions to the oil \nsupply, which seriously dampened the conf\nidence of companies and households. Now, \nthere is a variety of factors. As \nthey are partly structural in nat\nure, however, it is all the more \nlikely that the present shock will prove to be permanent.   To a large extent, the current oil price s\nhock has been driven by unexpectedly buoyant \ndemand for oil, particularly in \nthe US, and by rapidly growin\ng emerging market countries Œ \nespecially China. China™\ns share in global oil \ndemand has more than dou\nbled in the past 15 \nyears (3.5% in 1990, estimated 8.2% in 2006)\n. Despite higher oil prices, the demand from \nChina is expected to persist, because its underlying growth development is still ongoing.  \n The latest price hike, however, is being put down \nmainly to supply-side factors, namely, to \nheightened geopolitical concer\nns over the security of future \nsupplies, especially in Iran, Iraq \nand Nigeria Œ or the recent events in Bolivia.  \n Both factors are aggravated by yet another s\nupply-side argument: Spare capacities in both \nrefining and production are limited, as the inve\nstments of oil producing\n countries have been \nresponding too slowly to the unexpected pace of \ndemand growth. Now, it is taking time to \nopen up the bottlenecks. This view has been rec\nently accentuated at the G7-meeting in \nWashington where, amongst others, a strengt\nhening of the dialogue \nbetween oil producers \nand consumers and further investment in explor\nation, production, energy infrastructure, and \nrefinery capacity has been demanded.", "Page 7 of 17\n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nThe fact that the bulk of the current oil pr\nice shock Œ unlike its predecessors Œ has been \ndemand-driven is often said to alleviate its impact on economic growth. Oil price shocks lead to a negative domestic demand effect in oil-importi\nng countries resulting from a loss in terms \nof trade. A demand-driven shock offsets this \nimpact somewhat as foreign oil producers \nrecycle part of their income by importing capital goods.\n3 It should be noted, however, that \nthis additional deman\nd Œ owing to the oil-expor\nting countries™ specific needs Œ might lead to \nsectoral shifts in the production pattern of the euro area economy.   \nObviously, with oil prices being increasingly dr\niven not only by demand-side concerns, the \nnature of the current shock might eventually become closer to that of its predecessors.  \n \nApart from the size and nature \nof the shock, the resilience of advanced economies like the \neuro area stems from a structural change in \ntheir dependence on oil. O\nwing to the growing \nimportance of the services sector, which now \naccounts for roughly 70% of GDP in the euro \narea, the relative weight of \nthe energy-intensive industrial \nsector has declined since the \n1970s. Accordingly (and also due to a growing \necological awareness), the oil intensity of \nindustrial countries, defined as the total amount\n of oil consumed to produce one unit of \nGDP, has been halved during the past 30 years.  \n Finally, the reaction of economic agents, namel\ny trade unions, has contributed to the muted \neconomic impact of the current \noil price shock. Strong global competitive pressures, \nparticularly in the manufacturing sector, as \nwell as relatively hi\ngh unemployment rates \nsignificantly weaken the bargaining power of \ntoday™s trade unions. Inflationary pressures \n                                           \n 3 The fact that the recycling of oil \nrevenues plays a more supportive role \nfor oil-importing countries today than \nduring past oil price shocks has been confirmed for \nGermany by research undertaken at the Bundesbank \n(Bundesbank, 2005). Another channel of recycling oil \nrevenues is provided by financial investment \nopportunities in the capital markets of oil importers. T\nhe latter effect is estimated to have contributed to the \ndecline in the order of approximately 1/3 percentage poin\nt in long-term government yields in the US in 2005 \n(IMF, 2006)", "Page 8 of 17\n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nresulting from potential second-round effects \nand wage-price spirals have so far been much \nmore contained than in the 1970s.  \n The credibility of low-inflation regimes has no\nw been well established. \nTherefore, inflation \nexpectations have so far rema\nined well anchored at low levels\n. This has allowed central \nbanks to maintain a more accommodative m\nonetary policy stance, thereby providing \nongoing support to overall demand.4   \nIt should be clear by now that, for all these r\neasons, the oil price shocks of the 1970s differ \nstrongly from those of today. The recently \nchanging nature of the cu\nrrent oil shock with \nsupply-side factors gaining more \nimportance implies a certain ri\nsk, however, that this benign \nscenario may not extend into the future. Cent\nral banks therefore have to closely monitor \nongoing developments and act appropriately \nif needed. But what is an appropriate \nresponse? 3. The trade-off face\nd by monetary policy \nDoes the current benign environm\nent mean that oil price shocks \nhave lost their potentially \ndamaging effects and are no longer \na challenge for monetary policy? In my view, this is not \nthe case. A stability-oriented m\nonetary policy cannot afford to treat oil price shocks with \nbenign neglect.   \nA natural starting point to discuss this topic \nis provided by current macroeconomic thinking \non the determinants of inflation Œ which may \nbe summarised under the heading of the New \n                                           \n 4 This point is especially important in light of t\nhe fact that some research has explained the dampening \neconomic impact of earlier oil price shocks by t\nhe endogenous reaction of monetary policy (Bernanke, \nGertler and Watson, 1997; Barsky and Kilian, 2004).", "Page 9 of 17\n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nKeynesian Phillips Curv\ne (NKPC). According to this Œ now\n mainstream Œ building block of \nmodern macro models, current in\nflation is driven by expectati\nons about future inflation, \ncurrent and expected future demand and supply fa\nctors (both translated into the summary \nstatistic of the output gap) and cost-push shocks.   \nUnlike demand shocks, which affect inflation and \neconomic growth alike Œ \nthat is, either both \npositively or both negatively Œ cost-push shocks \nare more of a challenge. A surge in oil \nprices will raise inflation (at least in the \nshort term) while dampeni\nng economic growth, \nthereby constituting a trade-off if monetary polic\ny tries to achieve price stability without \ncompromising real economic developments in \ngeneral. The trade-off between inflation and output stabilisation in the face \nof macroeconomic shocks is also \ninfluenced by real rigidities. \nReal wage rigidities, especially, are important in this context.5   From the aforementioned,\n it is clear that the possible \ntrade-off for monetary policy is \ninfluenced by various transmission channels over\n and above the cost-push element alone.   Firstly, the better inflation expectations ar\ne anchored, the less a cost-push shock leads to higher future inflation.  Secondly, an oil price shock influences not \nonly output but also potential output. The \nconcrete relative factors are difficult to gauge \nfor policy makers in real time. Notwithstanding \nthis identification issue, it is clear t\nhat the popular notion of\n equating the observable \n                                           \n 5 See for example Blanchard and Gali (2005) or Krause\n and Lemke (2005). Real wage rigidities have the \npotential to create inertia in inflation rates. Inflat\nion then is not only determined by future macroeconomic \nconditions but also influenced by past developments. \nMoreover, real wage rigidities have the consequence \nthat for a wide variety of shocks Œ not only cost-p\nush shocks Œpolicymakers are confronted with a trade-off \nbetween inflation and output stabilisation. The reason for th\nis is that real wage rigidities introduce another \ndynamic distortion in addition to nominal rigidities. The \nlatter can be corrected by a monetary policy directed \ntowards price stability. Such a policy, however, would not\n eliminate the distorting effects of the former, that \nis sluggish real wage adjustments, and therefore be sub-optimal from a welfare point of view.", "Page 10 of 17\n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \ndampening effect of higher oil prices on GDP with\n a corresponding decline in the output gap \nmay be seriously misleading.  \n The problems are compounded by\n the fact that there is \nnot the one all-encompassing \nconcept to calculate potential output. In appl\nied work potential is \noften modelled as a de-\ntrended measure of real GDP or calculated \nwithin a production function approach. Taking the first concept, the dampening effects of oil pr\nice shocks on real GDP will translate into \npotential output depending \non the concrete statistical filtering method being used. Using a \nproduction function approach, a \npersistent increase of\n oil prices can influence potential \noutput directly via reduced energy\n inputs and indirectly via its \neffects on the capital stock: a \nhigher equilibrium price of ener\ngy inputs slows down capital \naccumulation and scraps some \npart of the existing capital stock.   Last but not least, in the New-Keynesian fram\nework, potential output\n is an even more \ncomplex concept and very different from \nthe de-trended measures \npopular in current \nempirical work. Potential output here refers to\n the output level that \nwould prevail when all distortions Œ be they static\n or dynamic Œ were absent.\n6 Not going into the details it is clear \nthat potential output is then in\nfluenced by a host of shocks hitting the economy. It is thus \nmuch less smooth over time than a figure ca\nlculated by applying a \nstatistical filtering method.7  All in all, it should be clear\n that oil price shocks have also adverse effects on potential \noutput, albeit difficult to quantify with any precision.                                             \n 6 In the base-line NK-model without real rigidities the st\natistic distortion is given by monopolistic competition on \ngoods markets, the dynamic distortion by nominal\n rigidities in the price-setting process. \n7 Cost-push shocks and real wage rigidities introduce anot\nher complexity in the NK-framework as they create a \nwedge between the output level that would stabilise in\nflation and the output level that would be optimal to \nstabilise from a welfare maximising perspective. With\n other words, the inflation stabilising output gap is \ndifferent than the welfar\ne relevant output gap.", "Page 11 of 17\n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \n Finally, a sluggish adjustment of\n real wages adds a further co\nmplication to the policy trade-\noff in the face of an oil price \nshock: a higher price \nof oil increases real marginal costs and \nthus inflation as long as the necessary dec\nline in real wages is \nnot brought about. With \nflexible real wages this poses no problem, wit\nh only gradually adjusting real wages the time \nprofile of inflation and out\nput also depends on the way \nmonetary policy reacts. A non-accommodating monetary policy can achieve the nec\nessary decline in real marginal costs in \nthe face of sluggish real wages\n by further reducing output \nthrough a tighter response. An \naccommodating monetary policy te\nmporarily allows for some in\ncreases in inflation and thus \nreal marginal costs thereby st\nretching the effects over time. \nWhich policy is optimal can not \nbe decided without a deeper analysi\ns of the causes of wage ri\ngidities and the possible \nstrategic interactions between monetary policy and wage setting parties.  \n In general: The more flexibly the real wage \nreacts to an oil price shock, the sooner the \nnecessary decline in real marginal costs c\nan be achieved and the faster the output gap will \nbe closed. A more flexible labour market is \ntherefore conducive to al\nleviating the conflict between price stability and \noutput stabilisation.  \n Admittedly, these more theoret\nical considerations do not provide us with a mechanical \nformula for responding to oil price shocks. \nBut they make clear \nthat the appropriate \nmonetary policy response in the face of a persistent increase in the level of oil prices is more complex than the often popular ﬁtr\nansitory blip theoryﬂ assumes.\n And they highlight several \nimportant insights which are also relevant in the present context.   Firstly, the New-Keynesian framework strongly \nemphasises the advantage\ns of price stability. \nMonetary policy in keeping inflation low correct\ns for the distorting effects of nominal price \nrigidities.", "Page 12 of 17\n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \n Secondly, in the light of the \nabove mentioned policy trade-offs\n monetary policy should not \nstrike the balance by responding in a discreti\nonary fashion to shocks. Rather, it should adopt \na systematic framework for decision-making and \nexplicitly apply it to the prevailing \nconditions.  \n By committing itself to a systematic monetary \npolicy approach, the central bank is best able \nto anchor inflation expectations at\n a low level. This should ulti\nmately lead to a containment \nof inflation at the \nlowest possible cost.\n8 And, as a by-product it will\n also lead to a better track \nrecord in stabilising real output close to potential.   \nMoreover, in that respect a credible and system\natic monetary policy may lead wage setting \nparties to a swifter acceptance of necessary real wage adjustments.   \nThe presence of labour market rigidities si\ngnificantly complicates the task of a stability-\noriented monetary policy. It is therefore in the natural own interests of a central bank to insist on making excessively rigid labour market struct\nures more flexible and\n not an overstretching \nof central bank competences, as it is sometimes portrayed in the public debate.  \n Summing up: Monetary policy is well-advised to fo\nllow these guiding principles even in the \nmore complex oil price shock environment. Focu\nsing on price stability to anchor inflation \nexpectations, acting in a systematic strategy co\nmpatible fashion, and not trying to fine-tune \nthe policy trade-off discretionary is the best way to confront the limitations of monetary policy \nin real-time and to limit the danger of becoming overburdened with tasks it can not fulfil. \n                                           \n 8 This point plays a prominent role in the current Ne\nw Keynesian framework. There, discretionary monetary \npolicy, even in a completely forward-looking environment, \nis inferior to a systematic response pattern under \na timeless perspective from a welfare point of vi\new (Woodford, 2003).

The Eurosystem™s economic and monetary analysis \nIn order to maintain price stability for the \neuro area over the medium term, the Eurosystem \nhas provided itself with such a \nsystematic framework: its m\nonetary policy strategy. Two key elements are a quantitative definit\nion of price stability by the Governing Council (a year-on-\nyear increase in the HICP for the euro area \nof below, but close to, 2% over the medium \nterm) and an analytical framework for the asse\nssment of all rele\nvant information and \nanalysis based on two pillars: \neconomic and monetary analysis.   \nThe economic analysis assesses the short to medium-term determinants of price \ndevelopments with a focus on real activity and \nfinancial conditions. The monetary analysis \nconcentrates on a longer-term horizon. It expl\noits the long-run link between money and \nprices and serves as a means \nof cross-checking, from a medium to long-term perspective, \nthe short to medium-term indications for m\nonetary policy resulting from the economic \nanalysis.  \n\n How does the Eurosystem™s strategy translate\n into day-to-day decision-making? Given the \nvigour and perseverance of the cu\nrrent oil price shock, its impa\nct on the euro area economy \nhas to be analysed carefully. The transmission of \noil prices can analyt\nically be separated \ninto direct, indirect and second-round effects. \nDirect effects focus on the increase of energy \ncomponents in consumer and producer prices in \nthe short-term. Indirect effects refer to \nmedium-term transmission to non-energy com\nponents. Finally, second round effects \ndescribe the inflation impulses due to endogenous reactions to \ndirect and indirect price \neffects by wage-setting parties. They creat\ne the danger of a wage-price spiral with \nsubsequently accelerating inflation.   So far, only the direct effects of higher \noil prices have been notic\neable, although they have", "Page 14 of 17\n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nbeen less inflationary than in the 1970s. Headline in\nflation is still being driven mainly by \nenergy prices. With core inflation remaining s\nubdued, indirect effects of the oil price shock \nhave remained contained.   The pick-up of the euro area\n economy is, however, expec\nted to cause a gradual \nacceleration of core inflation. This view\n is supported by the March Eurosystem staff \nmacroeconomic projections. And it demonstrates that\n blindly relying on co\nre inflation as the \nmajor benchmark for monetary policy would be too short-sighted at the current juncture.   At the same time, second-round effects have not\n yet materialised on a noticeable scale. \nWage dynamics in the euro area have remained \nmoderate in the recent past, though the \nrisks to this benign scenario have clearly risen ov\ner the past couple of \nweeks with oil prices \naccelerating once again. To prevent second-round e\nffects from materializing it is crucial that \nthe social partners continue to meet their responsib\nilities in this regard, \nalso in the context of \na more favourable economic environment.  \n Turning to monetary analysis, upside risks to price stability over the medium to long term are \nevidenced by strong monet\nary trend growth in an environment \nof already ample liquidity in \nthe euro area. The growth in \nmonetary aggregates is mirrored by\n dynamic developments in \ncredit to the private sector, especially in \nthe real estate sector. These monetary \ndevelopments constitute strong upside risks to \nfuture price stability an\nd they are stimulated \nby the low level of interest rates. They warrant particular vigilance and close monitoring.   \nSumming up: Whilst headline inflation clearly exce\neds our definition of price stability and has \nrecently edged up to 2,4 % under\n the impact of renewed oil \nprice increases, underlying \ninflationary pressures have, \nto date, remained more cont\nained. In the medium term, \nhowever, these pressures might gain in strengt\nh, as an improvement in the euro area", "Page 15 of 17\n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \neconomy is assumed for the quarters ahead, and o\nil prices may be passed-through faster in \nan economic upturn, rais\ning the risk of indirect and second-r\nound effects. Indirect effects are \nin the pipe-line a\nnd will most likely materialize. Additi\nonal increases in administered prices \nand indirect taxes will also contribute to inflat\nionary pressures. In particular, the expected \nVAT increase in Germany (+3 pp) next year is\n expected to keep euro area headline inflation \nat a higher level (+0.3 pp in 2007). Finally\n, monetary and credit aggregates are growing at \nrates much higher than is compatible with non-inflationary real growth.   \nSo, oil price developments are ju\nst one, albeit important factor \ncontributing to inflationary \nrisks in the current environment.   \nThe materialisation of these risks to price st\nability would be most undes\nirable as the HICP \ninflation rate has already been exceeding the le\nvel that is consistent\n with the Eurosystem™s \ndefinition of price stability for \na considerable time now and is projected to do so on average \nthis year and next year.   In the current environment, per\nhaps the single most important\n transmission channel of oil-\nprice-induced risks into higher future inflation c\nonsists in longer-term \ninflation expectations becoming unanchored. And while it \nis true that current long-te\nrm inflation expectations are \ncompatible with the Euro\nsystem™s definition of price stability this argument cannot be used to justify a monetary policy of ﬁw\nait and seeﬂ. As inflation \nexpectations incorporate the \nexpected future path of monetar\ny policy, and markets have pric\ned in increasing short-term \nrates in the quarters ahead, the ﬁwait and seeﬂ argument would run into inconsistencies.  \n The current low level of inflat\nion expectations is predominan\ntly the successful outcome of \nthe stability-oriented monetary po\nlicy framework itself.

These considerations are highly re\nlevant in the current situation, too. 5. Concluding remarks \nIn general: An important way an oil price s\nhock can lead to permanently higher inflation \nrates is through monetary policy accommodation.\n The most important explanation for fact \nthat the current economic impact\n of the oil price increase has \nbeen so benign lies in the \nachievements of monetary policy having become transparent, systematic and well aware of \nthe problem of time inconsistency. It would be an \nirony of history if we were to sacrifice the \ncredibility we have earned by gambling on possibl\ne short-term gains in neglecting current \nrisks to price stability.
