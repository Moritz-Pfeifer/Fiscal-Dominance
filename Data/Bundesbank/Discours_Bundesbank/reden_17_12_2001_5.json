To us Germans, with the United. States having stood by us for many decades following the Secend World War, from the Berlin Airlift 1948/49 to reunification in 1990, solidarity should not and will not be - as Chancellor Gerhard Sehröder put it a few days ago- a \"one-way street\". With our unconditional solidarity, we can now give back to you some of the support you have been giving us for so many years. I wish to express my heartfelt sympathy to all of those who lost relatives and loved ones in the horrible terror attacks of September 11. My sympathy also goes out to the families and friends of the victims of last week's plane crash in Queens. Even after these terrible few weeks, to me New York always has been and always will be a symbol of the peaceful coexistence of people from all backgrounds, one which is a shining example for the entire world. I am therefore especially pleased to be here with you today. I am, of course, also glad that you have shown such great interest in this event and that it was possible to organize this event despite all the difficulties involved. My thanks go out to all those who made this happen. I hope that this event helps bring us a little closer to a state of normality. I would like to talk to you this evening about \"The euro - the new European money\". When I spoke before the Council of Foreign Relations here 4% years ago on the subject of European monetaryDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 union (EMU), I still needed to provide a Iot of background. At that time, even a fairly sophisticated American dictionary . affered only two definitions of EMU. The first said: \"EMU = electromagnetic unit.\" The second said: \"EMU: large Aust:ralian bird that runsweil but cannot fly.\" Today there is hardly likely to be anyone who, upon hearing EMU, does not immediately think of European monetary union. lf you're thinking about coming to Europe next year, you will meet the euro wherever you go - because in just a few weeks it will exist in physical form. Paris, Rome, Brussels or Berlin: in most of Europe, you will be able to pay with a single currency - euro bills and coins - starting on January 1, 2002. For you here in the United States, it is natural that the dollar is legal tender in all fifty states of the Union. For us in Europe, though, monetary union is a quantum leap, both politically and economically. ' ln my speech I would like to address the following issues: 1. The historical background of the euro. 2. The essential features of the! new system and its ramifications. 3. The future outlook for the euro- the political agenda. The historical backgroun~ of the euro The euro is not quite as new as the title of my speech would Iead you to believe. ln fact, the euro is already a reality. The new EuropeanDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 currency was born nearly three years ago when Europe entered Stage Three of economic and monetary union. However, compared with the dollar and its lang tradition, the euro is a \"rookie\" in the monetary policy league. However, this \"rookie\" took the field after going through a tough \"training camp\" an the field of stability. Nearly five decades ago, far-sighted European politicians kicked off the drive toward European unification. Sure, this drive has repeatedly been hampered by setbacks. However, the thrust towards greater integration has ultimately been unmistakable. European economic integration has been firmly established according to the principle of an \"open market economy with free competition.\" This was not as obvious back then, as it seems today. Here in the United States, in particular, people might say \"what else?\" ln Europe, though, it would behoove us to keep reminding ourselves of what it takes for a market economy such as ours to function properly. Only by paying attention to fundamental principles - personal responsibility, individual initiative, entrepreneurial spirit, and competition- can social equity be achieved; and this is what is needed to overcome the severe structural problems that still beset Europe. We Europeans can learn much in this sphere from the United States. The latest and greatest step towards integration in Europe has been entry into Stage Three of economic and monetary union. The euro area countries have entered into a community of solidarity without any \"exit.\" There is no precedent for this unique project. ln fact, it canDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 rightly be called the most significant innovation in monetary history since the creation of the Bretton Woods system _in 1944. This project is also unparalleled because clear preconditions needed to be met before EMU could be launched. The countries participating in monetary union needed to pass a stability test beforehand. Only then could their currencies merge to form the euro. By contrast, in the past currencies only ceased to exist after having failed to function as a store of value. The historical, political and economic dimensions of this project are extraordinary. I sometimes get the impression that this is not being given its due on either side of the Atlantic - Europe or the United States. There still seem to be US investors who think that \"EMU is crazy- in particular for Germany.\" its economic in Germany. That should come as no surprise: importance to symbolize A single currency for Europe means waiving political sovereignty at the. national Ievei. This was a particularly difficult step to take for many people the 0-Mark transcended the postwar reconstruction of Germany. The 0-Mark stood for growing prosperity and Germany's international community. This success story also played a substantial role in the negotiations on EMU. Yet it was ultimately the courageaus political will and the success in convergence achieved in the run-up which made it possible to turn the vision of \"one market- one currency\" into a reality. Through this well-prepared yet courageaus step, Europe has received reintegration into theDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 positive stimuli. The elimination of exchange-rate risk among the countries involved and the greater integration of financial markets are advantages that are immediately obvious. However, the medium-term orientation of monetary and fiscal policy represents an even greater success. A European stability culture has emerged! This signifies a paradigm shift in European economic policy. The essential features of the new system and its ramifications The new European reality, with a new economic policy regime, is a rather ambitious one. The path chosen was not the usual \"one political entity - one currency\" raute but instead one in which a single monetary policy has to cantend with budgetary and economic policies which are stilllargely in the hands of individual nations. This is a difficult concept to explain outside of Europe, even to those who have been keeping up with developments in Europe. ln the United States, there are some people who sometimes wonder how Europe really functions. By the way, we in Europe also wonder sometimes what makes the United States tick. We must learn to understand and accept existing institutional structures on both sides of the Atlantic. A chosen economic policy regime must be judged against the background of historical developments, traditions and its specific regional environment. Naturally, the asymmetry between centralized monetary policymaking and decentralized economic and fiscal policy generates a certainDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 tension. The way to overcome this state of tension is to closely coordinate decentralized economic and fiscal policy at the European Ievei. Fiscal policy in the member states is additionally required by the Stability and Growth Pact to achieve the medium-term goal of a budget that is close to balance or even in surplus. One rationale for the Stability Pact was that it would be asking too much of a single monetary policy to be the sole defender of stability. The other was to keep government budgets sustainable. Public debt and the interest burden should not be allowed to go up after every economic slump as happened in the seventies and the early eighties. An additional factor is the unfavorable demographic trend in Europe. The aim is to regain fiscal policy room for maneuver and to avoid placing an undue burden on posterity. This fiscal policy self-commitment in Europe is \"revolutionary\". Fiscal rules of this type are probably unprecedented worldwide. Yet these rules are not a straitjacket. ln monetary union, the government. sector has an important role in stabilizing demand. Through automatic stabilizers, the government budget has a steadying effect on economic development. ln Europe, these automatic stabilizers are twice as effective as in the United States. One reason lies in the higher European general government ratio; another is the difference in the Ieveis of social transfer payments. Given a 2 % decline in growth, these stabilizers restore % percentage point of GDP in the United States, whereas in Europe it would provide a fiscal stimulus of 1% of GDP.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 As you can see, it is expressly not the objective of the Stability and Growth Pact to stifle the ability of the budget to breathe in sync with the economic cycle. The Stability and Growth Pact is seen as a burden only by those member states which passed up the opportunity to consolidate their budgets over the past few years and which have so far failed to achieve a sustainable medium-term position. However, this sustainable medium-term budgetary position is a basic precondition for fiscal policy stimulitobe able to generate additional demand in the first place. Given unsound financing, in the private sector only the saving ratio would increase - to make up for impending tax increases or cutbacks in transfer payments. This is an aspect which I am afraid is all the debate on European economic too often overlooked in programs. ln addition, there are indeed serious reasons for objecting to an anti cyclical fiscal policy. The time lags in the political decision-making process and in implementation are generally too great to preclude pro cyclical effects. The fact that it will tend to have an adverse impact on interest rates should not be underestimated, either. The situation from which fiscal policy starts out is a completely different argument. Here, the United States is in an entirely different position than Europe. ln the euro area, the general government ratio is justunder 49 % of GDP, and thus 1 Y2 timesthat of the United States. I intentionally placed fiscal rules in Europe at the top of my agenda for this talk. One reason is that this necessary implication of monetaryDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 union is often overlooked or not properly understood. The other isthat fiscal rules are occasionally pe~rceived as a barrier to greater economic growth in Europe. lt is easier to get across the message that monetary union requires institutional changes in monetary policy. Monetary union led to the creation of a new institution in Europe, the European Central Bank. lt is an independent institution with the priority task of maintaining medium--term price stability. This approach is based on a broad consensus c~mong central banks - not just in Europe but worldwide - that the best macroeconomic contribution monetary policy can make towards improving the economic outlook and raising standards of living is to cre~dibly maintain price stability over the medium and lang term. Within this consensus there are various concepts and different strate~gies that can also have a variety of ramifications. At any rate, monetary policy cannot work wonders. Chairman Greenspan a week ago put it that way: lnterest rate cuts are not an instant fix to every problem. However, it can contribute to low and stable inflation expectations. And stable money is a core element of ·the functional viability of a market economy. Transparency in price formation is improved by giving an undistorted view of supply and demand in the real economy. Keeping inflation as low as possible holds down Iang-term interest rates and minimizes the distorting effects of the tax and social welfare systems.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 Decades of practical experience and a wealth of empirical studies have led in Europe to the mandating of price stability as a priority objective and have led to the transfer of this task to an Eurosystem, which is free of political influences. This mandate has been used to develop a stability-oriented monetary policy strategy tailored to the specific needs of the Eurosystem. The changeover to a single monetary policy involved a pronounced regime shift. The structural and institutional changes and the resulting insecurity regarding the future transmission process needed to be taken into account when formulating the monetary policy strategy. For it to be able to perform its task, monetary policy needs to earn market participants' confidence. The monetary policy strategy must therefore be credible - while at the same time taking due account of the particular environment in which monetary union operates. Such a strategy must be clear, comprehensible, transparent, reviewable and compatible with the institutional independence of the Eurosystem. The ECB's two-pillar strategy meets these criteria. The first pillar, which assigns an outstanding role to the monetary aggregate, is designed to be the \"nominal anchor'' and recognizes that inflation is essentially a monetary phenomenon. The secend pillar undertakes a well-founded assessment of the outlock for price developments, incorporating the entire range of relevant cyclical indicators. Many critics claim that this strategy is inconsistent. For that reason, some recommend strict monetary targeting, while others say inflationDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 targeting is the way to go. I think the strategy chosen is sufficiently clear and reflects the specific situation the European monetary union now finds itself in. ln an insecure world, it is not possible to assign each of the two pillars a fixed and unchanging weight. Therefore, the information relevant to the price outlock is recompiled every time using the framewerk provided by the two pillars and subjected to a fundamental analysis. Yes, this concept is new and, forthat reason, takes some time getting used to. However, the euro was launched in a completely new environment, too. And this is why an independent approach was chosen. The assertion that the ECB's Governing Council bases its decisions arbitrarily on whichever pillar is most convenient at the time is completely unfounded. Today I would like to call on all of you to see this strategy as an independent approach alongside others and to accept it as such. Critics cannot use their own - wishful - thinking as a benchmark. And it should not be assumed that there isaglobal \"one size-fits-all\" monetary policy. Of course, this strategy being pursued by the Eurosystem requires a communication policy that meets high standards. Monetary policy cannot be successful in the long run if the public does not accept it. This is particularly the case with a young and independent central bank. lt must constantly seek a dialogue with the public. What is often overlooked is that the ECB is one of the most transparent central banks in the world, with a communication policy that goes above and beyend its statutory Obligations. Among the most important centralDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 banks, only the ECB holds monthly press conferences immediately after it has taken monetary policy decisions. However, a \"track record\" says more than words can. Credibility is gained by actions, not words. For the Eurosystem, this means adhering to the primary objective of maintaining price stability \"in a time-consistent\" manner. The decisions of the past two months have clearly demonstrated the ability of the ECB to respond quickly to exceptional events without giving up its medium-term orientation. The ECB has taken due account of global developments and has assumed its share of responsibility for the stability of the international financial system. ln my view, the ECB Governing Council's monetary policy decisions do not need to shy away from the critical attention of the public. However, we should not make the mistake of attempting to transfer the macroeconomic framewerk as it exists in the United States to Europe or vice versa. On the one hand, Iang-term interest rates in Europe play a more important role in investment decisions. On the other hand, Europe is more heavily regulated and has less flexible Iabor markets. The European automatic stabilizers are more powerful. ln the United States, wealth effects from the valuation of stock prices have a strenger influence on consumer behavior than in Europe. ln the seventies our attempts to implement short-term anti-cyclical lesson. The necessary economic policies adjustments came with a painfully high macroeconomic price tag. taught us a toughDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 Even today many countries are suffering from the. major debts run up in that period, which, in some cases, are over 100 °/o of GDP. The medium-term orientation of macroeconomic policies was hard-won. lt is precisely in troubled times that this orientation should be adhered to. The future outlook for the euro - the political agenda Weil now, what specific changes have taken place in Europe and what still has to be changed? Today's Europe does not resemble the sclerotic Europe of the eighties. Prior to monetary union, considerable adjustments were undertaken in the real economy, which are going to start having an impact over the medium term. ln 1. The economies of Europe have converged to form a single internal market. There are no more barriers to free trade in goods, services the nineties, many countries' state-owned and capital. enterprises were privatized, and markets were liberalized and deregulated- particularly in the telecommunications, media and energy sectors. Monetary union is the final stage in achieving the single market. The money market is fully integrated, and the European capital market is also making great strides toward integration. 2. Monetary union means that exchange-rate adjustments are no Ionger possible in the euro area. The exchange-rate distortions that have occurred time and again due to external shocks, and the attendant expansion of interest-rate spreads, are now things of the past. These advantages were already evident in 1998 following theDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 Russian and L TCM crises. These advantages have been equally evident in the past couple of months. 3. The euro-area fundamentals are quite strong. The results of the more medium-term policies, which have been implemented so far, have to be rated as positive. Since its inception, the ECB has largely guaranteed price stability. lnterest rates are low and conditions for borrowing are favorable. Wage developments are moderate, and government budgetary consolidation is making progress. However, there is no cause for complacency. Economic growth in the euro area will be araund 1% % this year; for Germany this figure will be % % at the most. At the same time unemployment, already high to begin with, will continue to rise - especially in the large economies. Europe's problern is that its potential growth rate is only a sluggish 2 to 2% 0/o. ln the event of a global downturn, Europe will therefore quickly be pushed to the brink of economic stagnation. The priority must therefore be to increase potential growth. This cannot be done over the lang term by deficit spending, nor is an even easier monetary policy the answer. Economic reforms are the only road that will Iead to success.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 Despite the creditable steps toward reform that were taken in the nineties, European economies are still struggling under a raft of burdens from the past: tiigh structural unemployment, a welfare state that is averstretehing the capacity of many countries, and future strains caused by demographic developments. The euro and the current economic slump have made structural problems even more apparent. At the same time, the euro will prove to be the most ambitious reform program of the European Union. Any economy refusing to become more flexible will be left behind. Just a few days ago the IMF once again called on European governments to tackle structural problems on the Iabor market through, in its words, \"a consistent and coherent set of Iabor market reforms.\" These problems \"head the Iist of remaining structural priorities.\" Especially in Germany, the issues involved are - among others - - - - - the degree of job security the type, amount and duration of unemployment benefits the wage formation process and wage differentiation the amount of non-wage Iabor costs and, by extension, social secu rity reform. Theseareall tasks that each country has to tackle and accomplish by itself. Monetary union requires flexibility at the national Ievei - since exchange rates are no Ionger available as an adjustment parameter. Prior to EMU's inception, many critics pointed out that only an optimum currency area could afford to forgo flexible exchange rates as an adjustment tool in the event of asymmetrical shocks.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 The mobiHty of Iabor as a factor of production in Europe, so the argument, 'is too restricted by cultural, linguistic and legal barriers to effect the necessary adjustment in a single currency area. However, one of the most striking effects of the history of European integration has been that real shocks are becoming increasingly symmetrical. ln addition, European economies are less regionally specialized in certain sectors of industry than, say, the United States. Therefore, the need for geographical mobility is likely to be a less important factor. Divergences exist in all currency areas, even in one as lang established as the United States. ln the euro area, inflation rates range at present from 1.6 o/o in the Netherlands. By comparison, in the United States the inflation rate was 2.4 °/o in Chicago and 5.0 o/o in San Francisco. Divergences in real growth rates in the United States are no less pronounced than they are in the euro area, either. Forecasts for 2001 range from 6.3 o/o in Ireland to 0. 7 o/o in Germany. ln the United States, the average growth gap between the individual states in the nineties was as high as 7 o/o of gross state product (GSP). in France to 5.4 o/o Of course, much remains to be done. There is a clear correlation between the politically urgent structural reforms and the international standing of a currency. The development of the euro's exchange rate since 1999 has not been satisfactory, yet it is not a measure. of the success or failure of EMU. The euro and globalization are exerting pressure on policies and markets in Europe to become more flexible.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 in the medium to ·lang At the same time, however, the reforms will - term - aceeierate the pace of economic growth and enhance the attractiveness of the euro area as weil as the single currency. What will be a crucial factor, is that policymakers co~mit themselves in a credible manner to tackling the necessary changes and, at the same time, to safeguarding the stability of the euro. As monetary history has repeatedly shown, a stable internal value is the precondition for gaining that sustained confidence of international investors, which also gives a currency its external stability. therefore, One of the main tasks of the national central banks of the Eurosystem at present is preparing for the cash changeover on January 1, 2002. This is a tremendous logistical task. lt is a great challenge to all of us. But I am confident. We will have a smooth transition from national currencies to the euro. I am also convinced that the issuing of the euro in physical form will help to improve acceptance of the new currency in Europe and in particular in Germany. The results of the latest Eurobarometer opinion survey show already a growth in support for the euro. ln the euro area, 66 °/o of the people support the single currency.' Germany is still lagging behind, with 53 % in favor of the euro; however, this is a significant improvement compared with the previous opinion survey. From an economic point of view the changeover is a non-event; but it is not a merely technical process. lt is the final and historical step towards further political integration in Europe. At least, I hope that the euro will also function as a catalyst in that direction. After all, historyDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 teils us that normally the territory of a political entity and the monetary area is identical. This is not - or nor yet - the case in Europe. As a consequence, monetary union cannot stand alone. ln the medium term, EMU will need to be underpinned by political union. ln particular, the stage of intergovernmental cooperation must be overcome in foreign and defense policies, and in domestic and legal policies. That means national interests have to become manageable and ultimately to be overcome in order to move on to truly common European policies. The deepening of European integration and the enlargement of EU offer a unique opportunity to integrate Europe peacefully and to create a region of stability and prosperity. Slowly but surely Europe is beginning to liberate itself from political standstilL Political processes taketime since they need to be supported by a public majority. The deepening of integration and the enlargement of the EU both need the support of suitable political and macroeconomic framewerk conditions. This includes in particular, favorable growth and employment trends, which, in turn, can only be brought about in an environment of price stability. For the first time in history, Europeans from Lapland to Portugal and from Ireland to Greece will use the same currency. And what is also of importance: for the first time since the empire of Charlemagne 1 ,200 years ago, French and Germans will be united by a single currency.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 I am convinced that the euro will become a symbol of identification with Europe and of the idea of deeper European integration- if the euro stays a stable currency. This symbol reflects a strong political will and a Iang-Iasting process of economic and political integration: - - - - towards an open market economy, towards free competition, towards tolerance and democracy, towards freedom and peace. * * *Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 Deutsche Bundesbank Ernst Welteke President of the Deutsche Bundesbank The introduction of the euro as a historic event Speech delivered at the European American Business Council in Washington on November 19, 2001Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 Ladies and gentlemen, lt is an honor for me to be here in Washington today. I would like to thank you for your kind invitation, which gives me an opportunity to discuss European Monetary Union with so distinguished an audience. Before I come to my main point, I would like to assure you that I feel close bonds with the people of the United States in these troubled times. lf you type \"historic event\" into your favorite internet search engine, you will get about 40,000 responses. Weil, of course, I did not check all the sites suggested, but be assured that there is quite a wide variety of \"historic events\". The introduction of the. euro was not among the top twenty hitsofthat search, though. ln discussing the historic dimension of the introduction of the euro today, we are not exactly walking a well trodden path. However, as I will make plain today, that introduction is a historic event. II The three large currency areas in the world - the United States, Japan and the euro area - tagether accountfor almost one-half of world output. Those three eotities share a Iot of similarities, but they are strikingly different in some respects. ln terms of population size, the United States and the euro area are quite similar, araund 300 million people, while Japan is a little less than halfthat size. ln terms of the share in world GDP, Japan is less than 1 0 percent, the euro area comes out in the middle, at 16 percent, while the USA accounts for rather more than one-fifth of world GDP. Per capita GDP, however, in the USA and Japan is about 50 percent higher than the euro area's € 20,000 per head. Ranked by openness - external trade in relation to GDP - the euro area is the most open of the three large currency areas, with its current account roughly in balance. The USA comes second with a current account in deficit, and Japan has its current account in surplus.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 Comparing the three areas with respect to the public sector's share in the economy, the USA has the lowest government expenditure, it has the lowest public debt and for the time being a budget in surplus. While the euro area has made some progress in reducing the government deficit and debt, the continuing slump in Japan has led to a rise in both measures of the scale of the public sector's activity. ln the field of finance, the three large currency areas showdifferent structures due to the traditions followed. Bank deposits as a medium of investment, and bank credit as a source of finance, predominate in Japan. Investors and financiers in the USA clearly prefer the capital markets. The euro area is claiming the middle ground, with a certain tendency towards a more market-centered system. Economic and financial integration is deepening fast. International trade has grown considerably du ring the last couple of years. Foreign direct investment flows have increased even faster. Portfolioinvestment has internationalized. Stock exchanges are moving more or less in sync. Growth rates are dwindling simultaneously in all three large currency areas at this point in time. That has very much to do with the higher degree of global integration yet underestimated by many policy makers. Growth of global trade will probably diminish this year to two percent after 12 percent last year. Among the major regions in the world only China, the Middle East and Russia, including some neighboring countries, will show substantially positive growth rates. There is something like a global business cycle. However, there is no perfect synchronicity among different areas. Causes, consequences and repercussions are different in every currency area. Therefore, policy reactions have to vary. The US business cycle is close to a technical recession. Remember, less than a year ago, forecasters wendered whether the USA would see a hard or a soft landing. The . downward trend of the high tech industry, and the corresponding overinvestment in ITDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 where prominent among the causes of the downward movement in growth rates. The savings rate rose abruptly and the Iabor market performed increasingly worse. After September 11, additional negative psychological impact has to be overcome. The USA responded quickly. The Fed lowered interest rates, the federal government lowered taxes substantially. Firms and markets do adjust quickly. I have no doubt that the US economy will again show rising growth rates within a few months. Japan- already in a prolonged recession- could not withstand this downward trend. Japan has to cope with an economy that is still recovering from the effects of the severe banking crisis that followed the bubble economy of the late eighties. Finally, the Euro area business cycle followed the world trend more closely than was Observable in recent years. This can be seen as an outcome of closer links due to increased foreign direct and portfolio investment. Growth rates diminished, employment gains came to a halt, and prospects for the next year have worsened over the last months. However, capacity utilization and sentimentarestill higher than, for example, in the recession of 1993. Adjustments take place, although slower than in the USA. As usual, expectations adjust faster than production. For Europe, psychological factors are no less important than in any other currency area. Different causes require different policy reactions. This is the first reason for varying responses of the three central banks. Another- equal important reason- isthat they pursue different concepts. The Bank of Japan is in an exceptional situation, anyway. The US Federal Reserve System was set up in 1913. ln accordance with the Employment Act (of 1946) and the Humphrey-Hawkins Act (of 1978), it must pursue several objectives at the same time: economic growth in line with potential output growth, stable prices, a high Ievei of employment and moderate long-term interest rates. The European System of Central Banks is \"the new kid on the block\" among the large central banks. Since 1999, it has pursued its sole primary objective of price stability.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 Differences in objectives and in strategy are the main explanations of the perceived differences in response to the current situation. For Europe, monetary integration is an event of historic dimensions. Joining forces to set up a common currency area promises prosperity and stability to 300 million people. The institulianal features of the ESCB provide for a framewerk enabling it to keep this promise. The success of the euro is one of the driving forces for Central and Eastern European states to apply for membership in the EU. lt is not only in Europe that efforts towards regional integration are being made, including notions of, and moves towards, monetary harmonization. Such discussions are likewise topical in all five continents: • A currency union between Russia and Belarus is the one that is most concrete at present. The two countries have decided to set up a currency union from 2005 onwards; at first, the Russian rouble will be their currency. • The member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council have been contemplating an Arab Gulf currency for some time. To further that initiative, they have recently set up a committee to take charge of studying the necessary requirements. However, political, economic and financial convergence does not suggest the early introduction of a common currency. • ln South America, monetary integration is envisaged for the Mercosur countries from time to time; however, with economic developments in Brazil and Argentina diverging more and more, a currency union Iooks rather far away. • The idea of developing an American currency union from NAFTA emerges now and then. Obviously, it has not been pursued with any real zeal up to now. • Talks about a possible yen zone have come up regularly in Asia. However, although trade and financial integration is weil advanced there, switching from dollar orientation to yen orientation does not Iook very likely at this point in time. • Deliberations on forming currency unians between Australia and New Zealand, or in Africa, are in a very preliminary state, as the political will to cooperate is lacking. lnDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 Africa, however, with the CFA Franczone and the South African Rand zone, two currency unians already exist. 111 European Monetary Union (EMU), which started on January 1st, 1999, has its origins in the 1970s, when the first plan of a single European currency was drafted. Not until the Treaty of Maastricht- signed in 1992 -·was the notion of a European currency put into concrete form. EMU is to be completed six weeks from now, when euro notes and coins are circulated. Monetary unians in Europe, however, are not unprecedented. Three of them were set up du ring the second half of the 19th century. Today's world resembles the 19th century world in certain respects. ln that age of industrialization, rapid international integration was witnessed. Transportation costs sank, and led to closer trade relations. Profound structural change was the result. As the European countries became more similar, their economies converged. ln that environment, naturally, monetary integration was deemed helpful. Today, we are in the age of so-called \"globalization\". Transportation costs, information costs and communication costs have come down tremendously. Structural change is taking place in the \"information society\". Trade and investment relations are becoming ever closer. This is especially true of the European Common Market, where freedom of movement is guaranteed for people, goods, services and capital. The case in favor of monetary integration in Europe is compelling. Let's have a Iook now at the 19th century currency unians in Europe, and find out what we have learnt. Just as drawing an analogy of the international setting is far from perfect, so is any comparison of the monetary unians themselves. We can, however, gain some useful insights from earlier experiences.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 ln 1865, the four sovereign states of Belgium, France, ltaly and Switzerland - Greece joined a little later- set up the Latin Monetary Union. The union covered only coinage, and had no common central bank. lt was originally constructed as a forerunner of a political union - which was never established, though. The founding treaty was open to interpretation in several respects, and that leeway was extensively exploited. Overall, commitment to the treaty was weak. One country was able to finance its public deficit by printing - or rather minting - money. What made those altogether rather heterogeneaus countries .stick tagether for more than 60 years was basically the need to tap the French capital market. The issue of the Scandinavian Monetary Union was rather different. Sweden, Denmark and Norway- all three countries now abstaining from EMU - pegged their currencies to one another in 1872. They aimed at economic, political and cultural cooperation. ln some respects, the Scandinavian union was more weatherproof than the Latin union. The three countries pursued similar development strategies, they were export-oriented, and they showed great adaptability to exogenaus shocks. Today, we would speak of convergent economies. Furthermore, the union treaty only spelled out what had been practised before. What made the Scandinavian Monetary Union fall apart (in 1931)? Against the backdrop of international banking crises, it seems as if the Iack of a single monetary policy framewerk was one of the reasons. Monetary policy in the three countries gained an increasingly national flavor, as, first, a pre-World-War-One expert boom hit the union asymmetrically. And so, a little later, did the war itself. Monetary policy diverged increasingly, until the unionwas formally terminated in 1931. As a third example, let's have a briet Iook at the German Monetary Union of 1871. The ground forthat currency union was weil prepared. First, the German Customs Union had already created a common market, although that had been hampered by theDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 existence of disparate coinage systems. Labor mobility in the common marketwas relatively high. Second, Germany had been united politically under the Iead of Prussia. The Reichsbank Act of 1875 then established a unified central bank to complete the German Monetary Union. lt introduced the German \"Mark\" currency one year later. What are the insights to be gained from these stylized facts about three earlier experiences of European monetary unions? We can identify certain features of such unians that seem to be conducive to the stability, and the success, of a monetary union. The European Union took these experiences into account when designing EMU. IV A monetary union is intended to provide the participating countries with a stable monetary regime that ensures price stability and enables them to thrive. The Maastricht Treaty set up the European System of Central Banks, with the European Central Bank - the ECB - on top. 8oth the ECB and the national central banks are independent. Monetary policy decisions are taken by the ECB Governing Council, which consists of the ECB Executive Board and the Governors of the participating national central banks. Unlike the centralized decision-making, the implementation of the single monetary policy is decentralized. National central banks provide the markets with liquidity, in accordance with the decisions of the ECB Governing Council. The primary objective of the European System of Central Banks is to maintain price stability. The ECB Council defines price stability as an increase in consumer prices in the medium term of less than two percent a year. Unlike earlier monetary unians in Europe, EMU was set up with a watertight monetary regime. We have one single currency, the euro. The ECB has the sole right to authorize the issue of banknotes. Troubles similar to those which both the Latin and the Scandinavian Monetary Union ran into, when the countries' central banks pursued divergent policies, cannot occur under the European monetary framework, where decision-making is centralized.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 A common stability orientation of all policy areas, to which all member states are committed, is essential. The secend stability-ensuring institutional feature of EMU is the Stability and Growth Pact. lt spells out how member states are suppi>sed to ensure sound public finances, as the Treaty obliges them to avoid excessive deficits. As long as national budgets are in order, there is no incentive for member states to pursue an overly lax monetary policy, with an eye to reducing the interest burden on their budgets. Wage policy is another national responsibility. Wage agreements have in general been settled in line with productivity advances. Low, and stable, inflation expectations reflect confidence in the Eurosystem's policy, and help in negotiating stability-oriented wage settlements. Research in the field of optimum currency areas has come to the conclusion that the member states of a successful currency union need to be what is called convergent economies. Gonvergent economies allow for a unified policy; divergent economies require differentiating policies. lts relative homogeneity may explain why the Scandinavian Monetary Union, over a long period, was more successful than the less convergent Latin version. The European Union has been developing a Single Market for more than half a century. The four fundamental freedoms - mobility of goods, services, people and capital - ensure that what had previously been a customs union became an integrated economic area. Convergence is progressing. Entry into EMU was and is conditional on the fulfillment of \"convergence criteria\". Countries willing to join the monetary regime must display a \"high degree of sustainable convergence\". That is measured in terms of price stability, exchange rates, capital market rates and sound public finances.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 ln a currency area, we have a \"one-size-fits-all\" monefary policy, and no exchange rates to cope with asymmetric economic shocks. Such shocks may occur despite the advanced state of convergence in the euro area. The countries of a monetary union are therefore in need of flexible goods, capital and Iabor markets. The EU member states are working to improve the flexibility of those markets. lnsofar as price rigidities exist mobility, as ensured by the four basic freedoms, is called for. Political union has, in the past, proved helpful in preserving the stability of a monetary union. The European Union is moving slowly but steadily towards that Iang-term goal. lts willingness to assume greater responsibility in the global context is encouraging in that respect. Overall, European policy makers have created a monetary union that is designed to last. Features which, in former currency unions, proved destabilizing have been avoided in the design of EMU. But institutional features alone do not guarantee EMU's success. Commitment to the Union, and a true European spirit, are called for. ln the ECB Council, we show this European spirit. National interests are not relevant to the process of shaping monetary policy for the euro area- the euro area as a whole. Ladies and Gentlemen, V At its start, the Eurosystem has seen a period of unprecedented price stability. ln 1998 and 1999, consumer prices rase by only 1.1 percent; in the year 2000, the inflation rate, at 2.3 percent, ran a little above the two-percent ceiling, after the sharp increase in oil prices during 1999 and 2000. This year, after peaking in May, at 3.4 percent, the inflation rate has been decreasing. ln October, prices were 2.4 percent higher than one year before.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 ln the current environment of a weak world economy, the ECB Governing Council is expecting a further moderation of price movements. At its most recent meeting on November 8, the Governing Council decided therefore to cut rates by half a percentage point. lt has lowered its key interest rates during this year by 150 basis points to 3.25 percent. The ESCB has been assigned one main policy goal: keeping inflation in check. lf possible without compromising price stability, it shall support general economic policiesThe reasoning behind this policy mandate is threefold. First, there is a purely economic reason. Keeping overall inflation low is the best contribution a central bank can make to sound economic growth. Furthermore, inflation tends to modify distribution in an unfavorable way. Second, there is the well-known principle of reaching a bundle of policy goals best if each institution is assigned only one of the goals. And, third, there is the argument based on democracy theory: once an institution is granted independence, it should be given a clear mandate in return. A generally stable currency, and markets that trust the stability orientation of central banks, make for lower price increases at times of crisis. They also anchor inflation expectations at low Ieveis. The larger currency area is able to cushion external shocks. ln its briet history, the Eurosystem has already dealt successfully with three external shocks and crises. Wehaveseen the Asian crisis in 1997-99, an oil-price shock in 1999-2000 and, most recently, the terrorist attacks. Europe did not escape unscathed from all these events. However, the low Ievei of turbulence within the euro area contrasts with sharper reactions to similar events in the period before EMU existed. This means that we have withstood what has been regarded as the worst-case scenario for the new currency. The European currency area exhibits greater macroeconomic stability, to the benefit of all its citizens, and also to the benefit of the world economy at large. Forthis greaterDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 macroeconomic stability to become reality, convergence is of paramount importance. Economic convergence is a precondition for the \"one-size-fits-all\" monetary policy really fitting all the regions in the euro area. A currency union, both stable and beneficial, needs convergence in all three respects: nominal, real and structural convergence. VI The European single currency tostered stronger economic integration by means of foreign direct investment. ln 1999, world FDI flows, at € 888 billion, were more than three times as high as in 1995. Intra-EU FDI flows grew significantly faster over that period. ln 1999, they were five times the size of 1995. ln addition, intra-EU direct investment has risen significantly since the start of EMU. ln the year 2000, it actually rase by 50 percent. Today, intra-EU FDI accounts for one-quarter of world foreign direct investment. FDI stocks show a similar picture. Intra-EU FDI stocks make up 22 percent of world FDI stocks. Almost one:-half of the FDI stock originating in the European union is invested in another EU member state. The FDI statistics clearly show, first, that economic integration in the EU is intense, and, second, that economic integration deepened fast after the introduction of the common currency. These Observations are borne out by the trade statistics. About one-half of the external trade of the euro-area member states is intra-euro-area trade. VII lt is in the financial markets that the benefits of a common European currency are to be feit most clearly. The implications of the euro are obvious: rising liquidity, deepening and widening of the money, bond and stock markets, reduction of transaction costs and abolition of currency risks. The euro speeds up financial market integration.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 Correspondingly, the functioning of the European Monetary Union depends heavily on a high degree of financial market integration. lts smooth functioning enables monetary transmission to work. Progress in this field is tremendous, but more is yet to come. Those parts of the European financial markets that are crucial to the transmission of the Eurosystem's monetary policy are already integrated to our satisfaction. The wholesale market for interbank liquidity in the euro area is now actually a single European money market. ln addition, European banks are interconnected in a common payment-system infrastructure. And improvements to the euro-area-wide payment system are being undertaken. A few days ago, the Bundesbank launched its new payment system RTGSplus, which improves security, reduces liquidity needs and expedites settlements of gross payments. Through this system, about 8,500 banks and credit institutions, including their branches all over the world, are accessible. The most impressive progress, in terms of integration, has been witnessed in the euro area band markets. Yield differences among the government bonds of the different participants have narrowed from more than five percentage points before EMU to some 30 basis points nowadays. The remaining spread is mainly due to the varying liquidity of the papers issued. Currency risks or divergent monetary policies no Ionger disturb the euro-area-wide diversification. ln terms of outstanding amounts, the euro-denominated band market is still significantly smaller than that denominated in US dollars. But in terms of new issuance, both markets are on a par. One reason forthat is the sharp rise in the new issuance of cerparate bonds. Here again, diversification within the euro area has increased. The issuers' nationality, as a determinant of the yield and performance of bonds, has been superseded by other factors, especially by a sectoral view.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 Accordingly, investors in the equity markets have shifted their perspective from country benchmarks to pan-European sector benchmarks. European equity markets arestill small compared with those in the USA. The market capitalization of domestic shares, as a ratio of GDP, reaches about 90 percent [2000]. The matehing figures for the USA and Japan are 152 percent and 68 percent, respectively. Equity markets in the Euro area are growing fast. The ratio of new issuance to market capitalisation averages over 4 percent. This is twice as much as has been achieved in the USA or Japan. Further integration of equity markets in Europe is being hampered by the segmentation of both stock exchanges and clearing and settlement systems. A consolidation process has started, and should be tostered by legal harmonization in the field of financial services. The degree of integration in the banking sector is mixed. On the one hand, wholesale markets and investment banking are largely integrated. On the other hand, commercial credits and retail banking still operate in national, segmented markets. Only a few European banks created by cross-border mergers start to offer retail services at a standardized Ievei for customers in more than one country. The financial system in the euro area is still highly bank-dominated. At the end of last year, credit financing totaled about 108 percent of GDP. This is twice as much as in the USA. The same ratio holds for deposits. ln the euro area, they account for 80 percent of GDP, while the US figure is about 40 percent. However, capital markets are increasing in importance in the euro area. Disintermediation is gaining ground. Financial markets have boomed in recent years and investment banks (as weil as non-bank financial firms like institutional investors, pension and investment funds) have enlarged their market share. Disintermediation will be enhanced by the need for pension systems to rely more on funded retirement schemes.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 Disintermediation will change the transmission process. Basically, it is speeded up. And disintermediation will change the income structure of banks. A rising share of fees and dividends, at the expense of interest income, will increase the volatility of banks' income. Since capital markets are more integrated than the banking sector, disintermediation will foster the integration of the entire financial system in Europe. Changes for the banking sector are in prospect once the new Basle Accord is applied. ln general, we welcome the new accord if it helps to improve the allocation of capital. However, two special features of the German economy should be considered: 1. The German economy is largely dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises, known as the \"Mittelstand\". 2. Our financial systems rely to a large extent on Iang-term financing. This long-termism of financing has contributed successfully to the stability and prosperity of our economy, as weil as the financial system. That is why the Bundesbank argues that banking regulation should not discriminate against lang term financial relations. Small and medium-sized enterprises with a revenue of up to € 5 million make up more than 95 percent of all enterprises in Germany. This \"Mittelstand\" forms the backbone of the German economy. However, their share of outside capital is significantly higher than with larger firms. A lower rating is therefore to be expected, unless other collateral or risk-lowering factors are taken into account. Here again, we favor a differentiated approach that does not put banks with a large disposure to small and medium-sized enterprises at a disadvantage. Since we do not want the new Basle Accord to endanger the prosperity or stability of our economy, and our financial system, we have to convince our partners to agree to a more differentiated accord. Let us share a few thoughts on the international role of the euro. VIIIDeutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 Three years into its life, the euro is the second most important currency in the world. lt took over that role from the Deutschmark. The euro has a share of roughly 13 percent in international currency reserves - about as much as the Deutschmark had before. ln this field, the dollar is the unchallenged Ieader, at two-thirds of international reserves. The size, deptn and liquidity of the dollar markets, as weil as the widespread habit of using the dollar for interventions and for pricing commodities, explain its predominance. As regards its use as a store of value, we find some evidence of the growing importance of the euro. 30 percent [at end-2000] of all international securities outstanding are denominated in euro. This share is slightly above the aggregate share of the predecessor currencies shortly before EMU was launched. That leaves the euro as the second-most-important currency in the international securities markets. Again, the dollar is the dominant currency, accounting for one-half of allinternational securities outstanding. A Iook at the flow data underlines the growing importance of the euro as a means of international finance and investment. ln its first year (1999) the euro was the most important currency for debt-securities issues that were aimed at the international market; in the year 2000, it fell back somewhat, to 40 percent. The currency composition of international bank assets presents a similar picture. Again, the dollar is the leading currency, with a share of 40 percent, while the euro is in the process of catching up. From slightly less than one-quarter at the end of 1998, its share rase to 27 percent, twelve percentage points of which were intra-EU bank assets. What can we see from these figures? Although habits in the international use of currencies change only gradually, the euro has already won a respectable market share. lts market share roughly equals the economic weight of the euro area.Deutsche Bundesbank, 19.11.2001 Furtherprogress in the development of broad, deep and liquid financial markets is a precondition for the expansion of the euro's international role. lncreased international use of the euro, as a currency for international reserve holdings, for investment and financing purposes, might have some bearing on monetary policy, but this potential impact seems manageable. Hence, in the Eurosystem, we have adopted a neutral stance towards the internationalization of the euro. We regard it as a market-driven process, and we neither hinder it nor foster it. IX Ladies and Gentlemen, For Europe, the introduction of the single currency is an event of historic scope. The launch of the European System of Central Banks came with a promise of stability and prosperity. Stability must be earned, again and again, day by day. The German \"Stabilitätskultur'' one may translate this as \"stability culture\" - is one of our most cherished exports to our European partner countries. European people now share a firm stability orientation. Prosperity must likewise be earned, again and again, day by day. The Eurosystem can and does contribute by providing an environment of stability, where prices are fairly accurate indicators of relative scarcity. The ensuing efficient allocation of resources is a precondition for prosperity. However, other policy areas can - and must - do more in this respect than monetary policy . .People in the European Monetary Union hold on to the single market and the single currency, because they know it is good for them - individually - and also for their countries. This, ladies and gentlemen, is why I expect a long life for the European version of a currency union, as shaped in the late 20th century. * * *Deutsche Bundesbank, 23.11.2001 Embargo: 23 November 2001, 16:30 CET Deutsche Bundesbank Ernst Welteke President of the Deutsche Bundesbank The Euro Goes East Closing remarks at the European Banking Congress in Frankfurt on 23 November 2001Deutsche Bundesbank, 23.11.2001 Deutsche Bundesbank Embargo: 23. November 2001, 16:30 CET Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, lt is always a pleasure to speak at such a gathering even as the last speaker. This time, an the eve of the introduction of euro banknotes and coins, the motto of this year's Frankfurt EBC has a special significance. Samething which has been vision from the very beginning of European integration is a reality: We have a single currency for a single market. And it seems to be very attractive for many non-participants as weil. At today's conference we have tried to envisage the future development of the new currency with regard to the accession countries. We therefore had to descend from the heights of lofty ideals to the down-to-earth task of analysing the political and economic realities. Today's first panel discussed the political agenda of the new currency and the implications for the future. The various participants in this panel represented quite different political and economic backgrounds in terms of the prerequisites for possible accession to the euro area. Even though countries such as Sweden, Estonia or Romania seem, at a first glance, not to have so many similarities, all three are bound tagether by the idea of a united Europe and by shared values. The second panel concentrated an the situation of finance and banking in the accession countries. A healthy, weil capitalised banking system depends an sound and robust financial markets. We have witnessed great advances in some of the accession countries. Same west Europeans are surprised by how far the transformation of certain markets has progressed. Finally, the third panel represented the point of view of the central banks. The single currency is highly attractive for some of the prospective members-to-be. Nevertheless, one should not play down the risk of a premature \"euroisation\". The enlargement to the east is by far the most important political project that the European Union has undertaken for the coming years. We have to seize theDeutsche Bundesbank, 23.11.2001 Deutsche Bundesbank Embargo: 23. November 2001, 16:30 CET unique opportunity to create a common future following a century of disunity and division in Europe. By overcoming the historical division of the continent, all member states will benefit. The welfare effects of the single market will more than make up for the effort expended in making the necessary structural adjustments in the accession countries. The introduction of the euro is not only a matter of delivering banknotes and coins; it is also a question of values shared among central banks. The concept of price stability and the establishment of central banks which are independent in terms of monetary policy is now a common objective of most European countries from Portugal to Finland. lt is a concept that is also reaching beyond the boundaries of the EU to the accession countries from Estonia to Cyprus. When speaking about common values and stability in Europe as a whole, we should not forget that the euro is already the officiallegal tender or de facto currency in parts of eastern Europe by virtue of the role played by the 0-Mark. ln some of these countries, currency boards exist, which are backed - entirely or in part- by national sub-unit denominations of the euro. These countries have already opted for stability. ln other countries, the D-Mark is, for the same reasons, the unofficial currency of choice. lt is estimated that, in the nineties, between 30 and 40 per cent of D-Mark notes and coins were circulating outside the Federal Republic of Germany. The widespread use of the 0-Mark is a vote of confidence for the monetary policy of the Bundesbank. The efforts of the accession countries to fulfil the Maastricht criteria are an indication that a \"culture of stability\" is gaining ground. They also show that the European System of Central Banks and the euro already enjoy a high standing in our neighbouring countries. At this point I would like to remind you that the monetary union not only has an eastern outlook with regard to the accession countries. lt also has a northern perspective within the EU. Our friends in Denmark and Sweden, andin the United Kingdom would certainly be welcome to join. From an economic point ofDeutsche Bundesbank, 23.11.2001 Deutsche Bundesbank Embargo: 23. November 2001, 16:30 CET view, EMU membership would be beneficial. The political question of further integration still has to be resolved, however. The European Banking Congress, which comes to a an end this afternoon, has to be seen as one link in a chain of conferences. ln October, the Bundesbank hosted an international conference with leading representatives of the central banks of accession countries. Today, we have discussed the present and future role of the euro. And, in just two weeks' time, the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank will be jointly hosting a conference in Berlin on the accession process and its implications. Topics tobe discussed will be the financial sector in those countries, the liberalisation of capital markets, exchange-rate regimes, and the process of convergence. Therefore, I would like to conclude this year's European Banking Congress by reminding you: We are living in economically rough times and under great uncertainty. We do know however: The euro is already a great success and the euro goes east. * * *Deutsche Bundesbank, 23.11.2001 Deutsche Bundesbank, 23.11.2001"}
