Financial \ninnovation has manifested \nitself in various ways, \nthe most prominent being the growi\nng importance of new and complex \nfinancial instruments, the increasing \nsignificance of new business models, \nespecially in the realm of securitisati\non and disintermediation, and intensifying \ncompetition, partly owing to the conso\nlidation process in the banking sector, \npartly owing to the rising importance of relatively new, largely unregulated \n\nplayers, such as hedge funds, private\n equity firms, conduits and SIVs. These remarkable financial development\ns are bound to alter the range of \nactivities financial market participants\n pursue. But are they also changing \nfinancial markets™ reaction to monetary policy?", "Page 3 of 17 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nThe starting point for answering this ques\ntion is easy to find: the monetary \npolicy transmission process. This term describes the long, variable and \n\nuncertain process by which a change in a central bank™s official interest rate \nimpacts first on financial markets and is ultimately transmitted to the economy \nin general and the price \nlevel in particular. As a signi\nficant part of this monetary \npolicy transmission process takes place \nin financial markets, it goes without \nsaying that the recent trends in global\n financial markets are of special interest \nto central bankers Œ and it\n would not have needed the \nrecent financial market turmoil to drive home that point. Against this backdrop, I will focus \nmy remarks today on the following three \nissues. First, have the recent structural changes in the global financial system \n\naltered the transmission process of m\nonetary policy Œ and, if so, do these \nchanges make a central banker™s life more Œ or less Œdifficult? Second, how \ncan central banks help avoid disturbances \nin the financial system? This is a \ncrucial question because financial stabilit\ny is a precondition for the effective \ntransmission of monetary policy decisions to the real economy. Third, how \ndoes financial integration a\nffect monetary policy tran\nsmission? Specifically, \nwhat is the current state of affairs in the euro area?  2 Financial markets and monetary policy transmission \nI shall start with the most\n general question.

For this \nreason, the Eurosystem closely monitors\n structural developments in financial \nmarkets. We also try to detect how fi\nnancial innovations could have modified \nthe way changes in short-term interest \nrates are transmitted to other financial \nvariables, output and inflation. \nWithout wanting to go into too much detail,\n it is essential to point out that, when \nit comes to the impact th\ne recent financial trends \nhave on monetary policy \ntransmission, several countervailing effect\ns are in play. These countervailing \neffects are best captured when unravelling \nmonetary policy transmission into its different channels, that is by cons\nidering individually the different ways in \nwhich a change in central bank interest \nrates affects economic variables Œ at \nleast in the short term. Let me focus on the channels and a\nrguments that are the most prominent in \nthe euro area. To begin with, there is t\nhe interest rate channel. According to \nthe existing literature, the development\n of deeper, more complete and more \ncompetitive financial markets seems to have strengthened the pass-through \n\nfrom central bank interest rates to mark\net interest rates. This can be put down \nto two factors: Consolidation in the \nbanking system, impl\nying the emergence of (fewer and) larger banks and thus improved arbitrage opportunities between \ndifferent financial markets, and an enhanced \navailability of alternative capital \nmarket-based instruments for debt financing.", "Page 5 of 17 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nIt is indeed likely that the increased \ncompetition between banks, as well as \nbetween bank loans and different financial market products, has led to a closer \n\nrelationship between market and bank\n interest rates. Consequently, the \ndeepening of financial markets should\n have amplified and/or speeded-up the \neffects of monetary policy on bank interest rates (and, other things being equal, on other financial variables, output and inflation). \nFinancial developments over the past dec\nade should also have strengthened \nthe balance sheet channel. Basically, \nthe idea is that, in an economy with \nhighly developed mortgage markets and\n a proliferation of mark-to-market \naccounting rules, changes in the value \nof collateral and wealth have a greater \nimpact on the economy. In such an \nenvironment, borrowers™ balance sheets tend to fluctuate more, which leads to a higher volatility in the amount of funds \nbanks are willing to lend to households \nand firms. Obviously, greater changes \nin the supply of credit will translate \ninto greater changes in consumption and \ninvestment, thereby strengthening monetary policy transmission. At the same time, a third prominent m\nonetary policy transmission channel, the \nbank lending channel, is generally s\nupposed to have become less important. \nComparable with the balance sheet\n channel, the bank lending channel \nemphasises that monetary\n policy can influence \naggregate demand not only \nthrough interest rates, but also through \nits impact on the supply of bank loans. \nWhereas the balance sheet channel focuses on the availability and value of \ncollateral necessary for b\norrowing operations, the bank lending channel refers \nto changes in the banks™ and borrowers™ funding possibilities.", "Page 6 of 17 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nUsually, two reasons are put forward why the balance sheet channel has \nweakened of late. Banks have become \nmore flexible because of the growing \nuse of securitisation and improvements in risk management. Consequently, \nbanks can respond more flexibly to chang\nes in financial market conditions and \nwill therefore not pass through each and every change \nin the central bank™s \nofficial short-term interest rate. Hence, other things being equal, the effect of \nmonetary policy on the overall loan suppl\ny has decreased. Moreover, financial \ndevelopment has not only broadened banks™ op\ntions in terms of responding to \ninterest rate changes; it has also broadened borrowers™ financing opportunities, \nreducing their dependency on bank loans. \nTo put all the arguments in a nutshell,\n monetary policy seem\ns, on balance, to \nhave gained influence on financial market prices and the real economy in the \nshort run. This is confirmed by the ex\nisting theoretical and empirical literature, \nwhich, by the way, delves much more deepl\ny into the intricac\nies of the various \ntransmission channels than I am able to do today. In any case, it should be \nborne in mind that the evidence is still tent\native. As financial development is an \nongoing phenomenon, it should therefore \nbe considered valid only at the \ncurrent juncture. Nonetheless, the bottom line is that, in the face of greater \ncompetition among financial intermediari\nes, financial innovation and financial \nglobalisation, monetary policy remains \na powerful tool for delivering price \nstability.  In this context, however, it is of t\nhe essence that the mo\nnetary policy strategy utilises a broad-based approac\nh in order to guarantee a \nrobust assessment of \nthe developments in the economy and on financial markets.", "Page 7 of 17 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n3 Financial stability \n3.1 Financial stability analysis \nLet me now turn to financial stability. A \nwidely accepted definition of financial \nstability is the ability of the financia\nl system to perform its key functions \nefficiently, namely, the allocation of\n capital and risks and the settlement of \npayments and securities transactions. \nThese functions must be fulfilled \nsmoothly not only in normal times, but also during periods of structural \nadjustment and stress.   For obvious reasons, supporting financia\nl stability is an important objective for \ncentral banks Œ and has always been so\n. First, as noted above, monetary \npolicy is largely transmitted through financ\nial market operations. Hence, the \neffect that monetary policy has on the real economy depends crucially on the \nsmooth functioning of financial intermediari\nes and financial markets. It is at this \npoint that financial stability analysis \nand monetary policy analysis are most \nclosely interlinked.  \nSecond and more generally, major macroeconomic objectives, especially price \nstability and sustainable output growth, \nare jeopardised if the financial system \nsuffers from instability. This is underl\nined by the generally high macroeconomic \ncosts of financial crises. In addition, th\nis aspect has gained importance since \nfinancial turbulences seem\n to have become more \nfrequent in past decades \nowing to accelerated growth in financial transactions and the greater \ncomplexity of new financial instruments.", "Page 8 of 17 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nThird, financial stability is closely link\ned to a central bank™s interest in the \nprudent design and management of the \npayment and settlement systems \nwhich process its currency. The Eurosys\ntem, for instance, \nhas the statutory \ntask of promoting the smooth operation \nof payment and settlement systems. \nAgainst this background, referring to financ\nial stability analysis as a new trend \namong central bankers would be somethi\nng of a misnomer. Indeed, financial \nstability analysis is anything but a passing\n fashion. It has, in fact, been a field \nof research of its own right since the \nmid-1990s. This is reflected in the wide \ndissemination of Financial Stability R\neports, which are now produced in more \nthan 50 countries worldwide.  \nNonetheless, it is fair to say that fin\nancial stability analysis is still, to a large \nextent, work in progress. To illustrate my\n point, let me outline briefly the kind of \nchallenges central banks face. To begin with, financial stability is not easily \nmeasured. This is hardly s\nurprising as, in contrast to\n monetary policy analysis, \nthere is no single indicator (such as inflation) to observe. Similarly, initiatives to \ncreate some sort of an all-encompassing \nfinancial stability index have failed to \nconvince so far. Instead, the concept \nof financial stabilit\ny involves various \nfinancial intermediaries, financial market segments and infrastructure, for which \na whole host of different quantitative and \nqualitative indicators exist. As a \nconsequence, determining \nthe degree of financial \nstability remains a highly \ncomplex task. \nAt this point, the natural suggestion f\nrom an academic outsider would be to \nconstruct a theoretical model. Such a \nsimplified representation of reality would", "Page 9 of 17 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nhelp the academic to single out the most\n relevant indicators and to define the \ninterrelationships between financial mark\net and economic variables. However, \nmodel-based financial stability analysis is still in its infancy. Three issues are \nparticularly striking. \nThe feedback effects between financial system behaviour and the real \neconomy are difficult to model, especially \nin episodes of stres\ns. Currently, most macroeconomic models treat key financ\nial system interactions and feedback \neffects only in a rudimentary manner. \nTherefore, the ﬁtrueﬂ co\nsts in terms of \nreal GDP that are associated with systemic risk in financial markets are difficult \nto determine. This is a significant limit\nation, given that feedback effects play a \ncrucial role in assessing a financial \nsystem™s vulnerabilit\ny to contagion and \nsystem-wide stress. \nAnother principal reason why episodes of stress are difficult to model lies in the \nfact that financial instability is inhere\nntly non-linear. As one consequence of \nthis non-linearity, risk factors typically \nare not normally distributed. Instead, \ntheir distribution is characterised by fat tails, implying that extreme values are \nobserved more frequently than what w\nould be predicted under the assumption \nof normality. Modelling non-\nlinearities greatly complicates research, but it is \nindispensable, given the central focus of financial stability analysis on default, \ncontagion and spillover effects.  \nA further challenge faced by financial stability analysts is a lack of relevant \ndata. First of all, historical time series on episodes of stress are rare, luckily. \nBut that makes it even more difficult to understand financial markets™ behaviour", "Page 10 of 17 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nin the fat tail of risk distributions\n. Moreover, and more generally, some of the \ndata needed for financial stability analysis still requ\nire development. With the \nexception of market prices and regulatory information, only a limited set of data \nis on hand in a timely, comparable and satisfactory manner. Think, for \ninstance, of financial intermediaries™ fi\nnancial reporting and the little information \navailable on credit risk transfer. T\nherefore, methods have to be found for \nhandling the shifting demand for data in\n an environment in which financial \nmarkets are constantly undergoing change. To sum up, feedback effects, non-lineariti\nes and the handling of a limited set of \ndata are prime examples of the numerous\n challenges encount\nered by financial \nstability analysts in\n designing financial stability \nmodels. As a co\nnsequence, it \ncomes as no surprise that \na standard analytical model of\n financial stability has \nnot yet been developped. At\n present, modelling is often scattered with respect \nto risk categories, financial market\n segments and structural or regulatory \nissues. Mind you, there is no reason to play dow\nn the progress achieved so far, on the \ncontrary. Financial stability analysis \nis becoming more and more sophisticated, \nas is borne witness by the increasi\nng number of related working papers and \nconferences.  As for the recent financial market turmoil \nŒ the trigger for the recent financial \nmarket turbulence, the speed at which it spread across global financial markets \nand its persistence were not foreseen, but that does not conflict with my \nstatement. Far from it Œ financial\n stability analysis does not aim for", "Page 11 of 17 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nclairvoyance. Instead, it is most likely \nthat financial crises will continue to \nemerge in spite of perceptibl\ne progress in financial \nstability analysis. But the \ncrucial point is that their impact can \nbe alleviated by warni\nngs, moral suasion \nand Œ if necessary Œ adjustments to th\ne institutional and regulatory framework. \nFor this reason, further im\nprovement in the framework\n for financial stability \nanalysis is a very high pri\nority for central banks.   3.2 Dealing with episodes of financial instability  \nThere is yet another reason\n why central banks need to keep well-informed on \nfinancial market developments. The t\nurmoil that has been affecting global \nfinancial markets since summer last year \nhas been a further example of central \nbanks not only taking a predominantly passive role in analysing and \ncommenting on financial stability, but also\n of playing an active part as well. \nIndeed, the role of central banks in cr\nisis management dates back to the 19th \ncentury and was reflected in the vi\news of Thornton and Bagehot. Both noted \nthat a central bank should Œ under specif\nic conditions Œ provide liquidity to the \nbanking system as a lender of last resort.  And that is exactly what happened when t\nhe crisis in the US subprime market \ntriggered a rapid loss of confidence among \nfinancial intermediaries on a global \nscale. As a result of it, uncollateralised\n interbank lending has been muted Œ the \nreasons for which are twofold. On the \none hand, banks™ willingness to lend has \nfallen sharply due to mounting counterparty \nrisks. On the other, the uncertainty \nbanks face with respect to their own longer-term liquidity planning has", "Page 12 of 17 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nincreased considerably. To alleviate \nongoing tensions in interbank money \nmarkets, central banks from all over th\ne world have acted as liquidity providers \nof last resort to the banking system.  As for the Eurosystem, we have so far \nstood the test in this challenging \nenvironment. Owing to the broad design of \nour liquidity operations toolbox, the \nEurosystem™s operational framework has \nhad to change only slightly since the \noutbreak of the financial \nmarket turbulence. What is more, the Eurosystem \nsucceeded fairly quickly in\n reestablishing confidence in\n the functioning of the \nEuro money market by promptly inje\ncting additional funds on a temporary \nbasis. We shall continue to provide liquidity flexibly Œ which seems warranted \ngiven the ongoing tensions in the \nEuro money market, including, and \nespecially, in the longer-term sector.  \nAlthough there have recently \nbeen some identifiable sign\ns of easing in several \nfinancial market segments, it is still too \nearly to give the all-clear. Specifically, \nthe still elevated level of money market sp\nreads underlines the fact that there is no room for complacency.  \nIn this context, I would like to stre\nss two points. In the Eurosystem, we have \nstrictly separated our m\nanagement of aggregate liquidi\nty conditions from the \ndetermination of our monetary policy st\nance. Hence, when deciding on interest \nrates, the primary objective of the \nGoverning Council has been (and will \ncontinue to be) price stability. Agains\nt the background of the continuing and \npersistently strong upside risks to price stability, the Governing Council is in a \nstate of heightened alertness and in re\nadiness to act. Moreover, our strict", "Page 13 of 17 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nseparation makes clear that the Eurosystem\n does not intentionally and directly \noffer some sort of ex post insurance \nto financial market participants who have \nengaged in excessive risk-taking. This \nis intended to limit moral hazard to a \nlarge extent. Apart from this, it seems appropriate to\n point out that, in a free market \neconomy, central banks™ liquidity support\n must always be confined to a \ntransitional period. In other words, in the medium run, central bank \ninterventions cannot substitute the n\need for financial intermediaries to regain \nconfidence gradually. At the \ntop of the list of requirem\nents, I would like to see \nfinancial intermediaries trying to en\nhance their transparency regarding credit \nand market risk exposures and also, if \nnecessary, raising capital and adjusting \nbusiness models. Furthermore, it is e\nssential that financial intermediaries \nconvince investors that the financial syst\nem as a whole is capable of managing \nrisks adequately in a setting of continu\nously changing financial market trends. Finally, taking a step back from crisis\n management, the recen\nt financial market \nturmoil has underscored the need for crisis\n prevention to be strengthened. This \nis exactly what is taking place at the moment. National, European and \n\ninternational forums and organisations are \ncurrently putting a lot of effort into \nidentifying the lessons to be learned. \nThere are various initiatives under way, \nbut it is particularly important that t\nhe recommendations made by the Financial \nStability Forum are implemented rapidly and \neffectively. The implementation of \nthese recommendations, including those on disclosure standards and risk \nmanagement, will be a major step forward in enhancing the resilience of the \ninternational financial system.", "Page 14 of 17 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n4 Financial integration in the euro area \nIf I were governor of a ce\nntral bank whose currency \narea coincided with the \nboundaries of its financial m\narkets, I could end my speech here with a brief \nsummary. However, as governor \nof a central bank that is\n an integral part of the \nEurosystem, there is yet another topic to\n cover: financial integration. It is \ngenerally accepted that, in \na currency union, well-inte\ngrated financial markets \nfacilitate the implementation of the \nsingle monetary policy. There are three \naspects worth mentioning. First, a currency union should work m\nore smoothly, the more integrated the \nnational financial markets are. Indeed, fi\nnancial integration can help individual \nEMU member states to absorb country\n-specific shocks more easily. The \nreason for this is that the more diversif\nied the sources of national income and \nthe easier it is to borrow abroad, the \nless consumption and investment need to \nfollow fluctuations in national outpu\nt. Hence, national consumption and \ninvestment levels can be insulated fr\nom domestic macroecon\nomic shocks via \ncross-border risk sharing. \nSecond, financial integration strengthens the stability of the euro area financial \nsystem Œ and of the macro economy in gener\nal. Basically, in a well-integrated \nfinancial system, risks tend to be more \ndiversified on a cross-border scale which should lead to financial inte\nrmediaries, markets and infrastructure \nbecoming more resilient to idiosyncratic \nshocks. Having said that, integrated \nfinancial markets arguably \nbroaden the scope for sp\nillover effects across borders Œ as manifested by the recent US subprime crisis.", "Page 15 of 17 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nThird, I have already stated that th\ne Eurosystem™s tasks \ninclude the smooth \noperation of payment and settlement systems Œ which is closely linked to the \n\nprogress of financial integration. Ther\ne is an abundance of evidence that the \nlaunch of the euro was a major catalyst\n for financial integration in the euro \narea. In general, financial integr\nation is most advanced \nin those market segments \nwhich are the closest to the single monetary policy. This is particularly visible in \nthe unsecured money market, which was almost perfectly integrated right at \n\nthe start of EMU, as measured by the \nlow cross-country st\nandard deviation of \nthe average overnight lending rates\n among euro area countries. Moreover, the \neuro has significantly reduced home bi\nas in the euro area bond and equity \nmarkets, albeit to varying degrees. Pr\nincipally, financial integration has progressed most in government bond mark\nets and is least advanced in equity \nmarkets. Having said that, the percent\nage of cross-border holdings of bonds \nand equities in the euro area \nhas grown over the past \nten years. In addition, \nbond market yields and share prices are in\ncreasingly being driven by common \neuro-area factors, although local factors \ncontinue to play a role. These \ndevelopments have been supported by the el\nimination of currency risk within \nthe euro area, the higher dem\nand from a larger pool of investors, and Œ as far \nas bonds issued by smaller member \nstates and companies are concerned Œ \nthe reduction of liquidity premiums in\n domestic-currency debt.

True, euro-\narea sovereign spreads vis-à-vis the German benchmark have increased \nsubstantially. Moreover, cr\noss-border country and cross-\nsector dispersions in \neuro area equity returns have risen si\nnce the second half of 2007. Both \nexamples indicate that national factor\ns in market dynamics and asset pricing \nhave regained importance in a time of fi\nnancial market tensions. But the scale \non which this has happened is still small in comparison with the major \n\ndevelopments of the past ten years. As already noted, financial integration in the euro area has not proceeded at \nthe same pace across all sectors and mark\nets. Integration of\n the retail banking \nmarkets, for instance, ha\ns remained limited, reflectin\ng the persistence of legal, \ninstitutional and cultural differences. This\n shows that financial integration in the \neuro area is dependent not only on how close a market segment is to monetary \npolicy, but also on how far the relevant\n market infrastructures have become \nintegrated. A case in point is the high \ndegree of integration \nof the large-value \npayment systems in the euro area. They \nhave made possible the integration of \neuro area money markets. TARGET2, offe\nred by the Eurosystem, is a further \nstep forward in that direction. Other efforts to reduce infrastructure barriers are \nunder way.
