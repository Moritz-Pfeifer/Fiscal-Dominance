Philip not\nes that there are still many barriers to \nfull integration, but that initiatives, such as SEPA, Target 2 and T2S should \nremove some of these obstacles.

Kalemli-Ozcanet al.\n3 Home bias \nTo complement Philip™s findings on fi\nnancial integration \nin bond and equity \nmarkets, I would like to \nfocus on one issue of great im\nportance: To what extent \nhas investors™ home bias changed over the past decade? Using German data it can be shown nicely, first, that home \nbias has declined and second, that EMU \nplays a prominent role in how the portfolios of German investors are diversified \ninternationally.    \n   \n  To start with some theory, Solnik™s\n1 (1974) international Capital Asset Pricing \nModel predicts Œ given there are no t\nransaction costs Œ that the regional \ndiversification of a securities portfo\nlio should be the same in all countries \nworldwide and it should copy the \nstructure of the global portfolio.                                            \n 1  Solnik, B., An Equilibrium Model of the International\n Capital Markets, Journal of Economic Theory, 8, 1974, \np. 500-524.", "Page 5 of 13 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nIn reality, the portfolios in all countries show divergences from this ﬁbenchmark \nportfolioﬂ in favour of domestic securities; this ﬁhome bi\nasﬂ can be explained by transaction costs and imperfect information, in particular, concerning foreign \nsecurities. In the euro area, transaction costs should have declined significantly with the \nabolition of exchange rate movement\ns within the European Monetary Union \nand further initiatives for harmonising the financial market institutions by the \nFinancial Services Action Plan (FSAP). At the same time, information on \nforeign investments can be expected to\n have improved within EMU. To see \nwhether these predictions are true, I \nshall now investigate the regional \nstructure of the German international inve\nstment position. German investors™ \npreference for domestic securities is ca\nlculated by comparing the share of \nactual foreign assets held by German investors with the percentage of foreign \nassets in the global benchmark portfolio.\n2 Against this backdrop, home bias on the \nassets side indicates whether foreign \nsecurities are less intens\nively (and domestic sec\nurities are more strongly) \nrepresented in the national portfolio \ncompared with the benchmark. A home \nbias would reach the value \n100 if investors were to ta\nke exclusively domestic \nsecurities into their portfolios. If the be\nnchmark portfolio is perfectly copied, the \nhome bias would carry the value 0.\n A negative number of the home bias \nindicates that domestic investors invest more heavily in the securities of a \n                                           \n 2 The calculations are similar to those carried out \nby De Santis, Roberto A. and Gérard, Bruno (2006), \nFinancial Integration, International Portfolio Choice\n and the European Monetary Union, ECB Working Paper \nSeries, No. 626, May.", "Page 6 of 13 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \n13 November 2008\n5of 10\nHome biasin German equityportfolios\nNote: Equity portfolios include investment certificates.

This is reflected in the \ndisproportionately large representation of \nGerman bonds in the portfolios of the \nother EMU member states.  To put it in a nutshell,\n the data on home bias and \nﬁEMU biasﬂ with regard to \nGerman cross-border investment in secu\nrities give an idea of how EMU has \ninfluenced cross-border financ\nial integration.

This distinction is of major relevance with respect to the \n\nfurther process of integration.  \nThe authors™ focus on banking integrat\nion is appropriate with regard to the \nsubsequent analysis of consumption \nrisk sharing, where bank lending is \ndeemed to be a prominent transmission channel. However, it should be kept in \nmind that there are more fi\nnancial market segments of\n interest and that the \neuro and harmonisation policies might affect\n them to a different degree.

First, consumption smoothing is \nmeasured relative to a panel of 20 \nEuropean and non-European countries. This \nreflects the fact that the paper \nconcentrates on differences in co\nnsumption growth ac\nross countries and, \ntherefore, analyses internati\nonal consumption smoothing. Domestic smoothing \nis thereby ignored. Furthermore, the estimates do not make a distinction \n\nbetween whether consumption smoothing of \nEMU countries takes place within \nthe euro area or vis-à-vis the rest of the w\norld. It is true that, from a welfare \npoint of view, a distinction between \nintra and extra-euro-area risk sharing does \nnot make sense. However, the auth\nors™ conclude that \nﬁthe increased cross-\nbanking integration due to the euro has im\nproved ex-post the optimality of the \ncurrency union by improving risk sharingﬂ. Th\nis implies that risk sharing of euro \narea countries takes place mainly among each other. My second comment concerns the way \nthe authors measure consumption \nsmoothing. The paper regresses international differences in consumption \ngrowth on international differences in\n GDP growth, multiplied by a term \nincluding banking integration. A perfect consumption smoothing would imply \nthat asymmetric GDP shocks do not transmit into diverging consumption paths \n\nat all.", "Page 11 of 13 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nFollowing Asdrubali, Sørensen and Yosha (1\n996) and the modification of Mélitz \n(2004), it might be helpful \nnot to stop here but to ha\nve a further look at the \nindividual components of GDP and the re\nspective channels of risk sharing.\n3 Expressed in logarithms and first di\nfferences, GDP growth can be decomposed into4 CGDPCGDPlnlnlnln      smoothing)on (consumptin)consumptio private of(growth  or, in more detail, \nCAAGNPGNPGDPCGDPlnlnlnlnlnlnlnln       In this disaggregation, we would expect the term \nAGNPlnln to be the main channel through which consumption smoothing by cross-border banking integration should work.                                             \n 3 Asdrubali, P., B.
