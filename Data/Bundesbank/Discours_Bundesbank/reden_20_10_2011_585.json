For more than four years now, we have been plagued by a crisis that \n\nhas changed its appearance on a number of \noccasions. It spread from the US \nproperty market to the global financial sy\nstem, from there to the real economy, \nleading finally to a sovereign debt crisis in several euro area countries. A \n\nsovereign debt crisis Œ let me emphasise this \nexplicitly Œ that is a severe test for \nmonetary union, but is not a crisis of\n the euro. The euro is\n a stable currency, \nboth internally and externally. Politicians are at pains to resolve the crisis, yet a consistent approach has been \nlacking to date. Meanwhile, we are losi\nng valuable time and, given the rapidly \nrising levels of sovereign debt, politicians\n™ scope for action is steadily shrinking. \nAt the same time, uncertainty is growing on the markets around the globe and", "Embargo: 4.00 pm CET on 20 October 2011\n  Page 3 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundes\nbank.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nthe confidence of the general public is at risk of becoming lost. This makes it all \nthe more important to find a consistent approa\nch to resolving the crisis in order \nto restore calm to the markets and to ma\nintain the public™s confidence in the \nsingle currency. In looking for such \na solution approach, one that will stabilise \nmonetary union also in the long term, it is\n worth taking a brief look at the root \ncauses of the current crisis. \n2 The causes of the sovereign debt crisis Œ a brief overview \nIt is generally known that there w\nere unsound economic \ndevelopments in a \nnumber of euro area member countries. Ab\nove all, these included excessive \nlending, asset price bubbles and a loss \nof competitiveness. \nThese structural \nshortcomings were the br\needing ground for the sovereign debt crisis. \nHowever, two fundamental problems are di\nrectly responsible for the sovereign \ndebt crisis. First, the institutional framework of monetary union was obviously \ntoo weak to prevent excessive fiscal defic\nits. The Stability and Growth Pact lays \ndown rules that are intended to restri\nct government deficits and sovereign debt. \nThe political will to enforce these rules was lacking, however. Instead, they were \ncircumvented and, in some cases, ev\nen actively bent. Sovereign debt in the \neuro area could not be contained as a result. \nSecond, there were weaknesses in the \nfinancial system. This applies, on the \none hand, to investors™ risk awareness. \nFor example, before \nthe crisis, they demanded very low risk premiums from\n the euro area countries across the", "Embargo: 4.00 pm CET on 20 October 2011\n  Page 4 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundes\nbank.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nboard. Their risk awareness did not increase until the problems in Greece \nbecame apparent. On the other hand, this al\nso applies to the possible spread of \nthe sovereign debt crisis via vulnerable banking systems. It was this very \nproblem of contagion that made rescue me\nasures necessary in the first place. \nUp until now, aid to Greece has always been justified by the objective of \n\nensuring financial stability\n throughout the euro area. \nThe bottom line is that \npublic finances also benef\nit from stable financial \nsystems, because they \nproduce fewer crises that might ne\ncessitate government rescue measures. Thus, in order to get the \nsovereign debt crisis under \ncontrol and create a stable \nmonetary union, the financial syste\nm needs to be st\nrengthened and the institutional framework of Eu\nropean Monetary Union improved. \n3 A stable financial system for a stable monetary union \nOf course, strengthening th\ne financial system is an im\nportant task, irrespective \nof the sovereign debt crisis. Since the fi\nnancial and economic crisis at the latest, \ncreating a stable and resilient financial sy\nstem is a matter of global concern. In \nfact, a number of improvements have already been made in this context. Basel \nIII has been approved, entailing extensive \nnew rules for banks. The new capital \nand liquidity requirements in particul\nar will make the banking system more \nstable. What is important now is to implement these new rules at global and at \nEuropean level.", "Embargo: 4.00 pm CET on 20 October 2011\n  Page 5 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundes\nbank.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nYet even though much has already been ac\nhieved with Basel III, a great deal \nremains to be done. Problem areas at \nthe moment include special rules for \nsystemically important banks and the \ntreatment of previously unregulated \nsegments of the financial system, namely the shadow banking system. \nSuggestions have been made in the meant\nime, which will be discussed at the \nforthcoming G20 summit at the beginning \nof November. My impression of the \nmeeting of the G20 in Paris last week\nend is: on the whole, we are on the right \npath. And we should not use up o\nur energy on projects that might\n divert us from that \npath. In my opinion, one such project is the financial transaction tax; for in terms \nof financial stability, the benefit of such a tax is less clear-cut than assumed, \n\nwhilst the debate often fails to take the costs and side-effects into consideration. It is quite possible that a financial t\nransaction tax may heighten rather than \nreduce the volatility of the markets. \nMoreover, two factors \ncast doubt on the \neffectiveness of a financial transaction ta\nx. First, profit expectations and the risk \nof loss are so high in times of crisis \nthat not even a tax is likely to curb \nspeculative transactions very much. Se\ncond, such a tax would only really be \neffective if it were introduced worldwi\nde. We certainly cannot expect that to \nhappen. Even if such a tax were introduced at EU level, which is more than \nunlikely, competition with countries out\nside the EU would be distorted as a \nresult. The ensuing costs would then be \nborne not by the finan\ncial sector but by \nthe real economy.", "Embargo: 4.00 pm CET on 20 October 2011\n  Page 6 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundes\nbank.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \n4 Two paths to a stable monetary union \nA stable financial system, then, is a corner\nstone of a stable monetary union. Yet \nto get to the heart of t\nhe problems, European Monetary \nUnion itself needs to be \nreformed. Essentially, there are two paths to\n a stable monetary union: the first is \nby strengthening the institutional fram\nework currently in pl\nace Œ a strengthening that must go well beyond what has be\nen achieved to date; \nthe second path lies \nin centralising fiscal policy Œ \nin other words: fiscal union. 4.1 Strengthening the existing institutional framework \nWith regard to the first path, I do not \nshare the frequently ex\npressed fear that the present framework is unsuitable f\nor a monetary union. \nNevertheless, there \nis, of course, considerable need for adjus\ntment. This is true of three points in \nparticular.  First, the no bail-out principle has to \nbe expressly reaffirmed. Investors in \nthe financial markets will sanction misguided fiscal po\nlicy in a timely fashion \nonly if they stand to lose money if th\ney do not. Of course\n, this presupposes \nthat the regulation of the financial \nmarkets offers incentives for risk-\nconscious behaviour.  Second, the Stability and Growth Pact\n must be given ﬁt\neethﬂ. There needs \nto be a much greater automatism in the Stability and Growth Pact for \n\nimposing sanctions when the deficit and \ndebt limits are breache\nd. Yet this is \nprecisely what is missing from the late\nst resolutions aimed at reforming the", "Embargo: 4.00 pm CET on 20 October 2011\n  Page 7 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundes\nbank.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nPact. The automatism does not yet go far enough in my view Œ there are \nstill too many exceptions and too much\n scope for political interference. To \nparaphrase Otmar Issing, sinners are \nstill passing judgment on other \nsinners. In principle, the Pact has b\neen given ﬁmore biteﬂ, but it remains \nquestionable whether politicians will let \nit off the leash when push comes to \nshove.  Third, monetary union needs a perm\nanent crisis mechanism, which could \nbe brought into play in th\ne event of a crisis that\n threatens financial stability \nthroughout the euro area. However, three points are crucial in this context. \nFinancial assistance for individual countri\nes must be tied to strict economic \nand fiscal policy conditions; assistance must be made subject to \n\nappropriate interest rate premiums; and private creditors must be involved \nshould the country in question default. Above all, a crisis mechanism must \nnot be used to brush aside important \nprinciples under the \nsmokescreen of safeguarding financial stability. Th\nese principles include subsidiarity, individual countries™ respo\nnsibility for their own fiscal policy and the no bail-out principle I have just mentioned. \nAgainst this backdrop, a critical view has \nto be taken of at least some elements \nof the decisions taken recently by th\ne euro area™s heads of state or government. \nAllow me to mention three problems.  The first problematic aspect is that \nconditions for granting emergency loans \nwere loosened. In the meantime, t\nhey are more favourable than those \nborne by some of the countries providing assistance when they tap the \n\ncapital market. But the less a country has\n to pay for assistance, the smaller,", "Embargo: 4.00 pm CET on 20 October 2011\n  Page 8 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundes\nbank.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nof course, is its incentive to consolidat\ne its public finances and return to the \ncapital markets. Adopting these cond\nitions also for future aid programmes \nor even for the permanent crisis mec\nhanism would perpetuate the problem. \nThis cannot be our objective.  A second problem is that gover\nnment bonds may be purchased on the \nsecondary market through the crisis mechanism in future. If bonds of \ncountries without an assistance pro\ngramme are purchased, it is unclear \nhow consolidation and reform conditions\n can be enforced. Nor is it clear \nhow this squares with the requiremen\nt that assistance\n can only be granted \nif the stability of the entire euro area is under threat. Ultimately, therefore, \nthe possibility of secondary\n market purchases undermin\nes the incentives to \npursue a sound budgetary policy. Moreov\ner, one point is often overlooked: \nsecondary market purchases are a \nvery crude and, \nindeed, a rather \nineffective instrument f\nor stabilising the financial markets and influencing countries™ funding conditions. Thus, mu\nch larger amounts will be needed to \nachieve a particular result. This increases the risk for the taxpayers of the \ncountries providing assistance. \n A third problem is the topic current\nly under discussion, that of leveraging \nthe crisis mechanism Œ which is to say,\n first of all, a leveraging of the EFSF. \nProposals of this kind are closely link\ned to the topic of secondary market \npurchases; for, since its recently\n approved extension, the EFSF has \nsufficient funds for the classical inst\nruments of the rescue shield Œ direct \nemergency loans to individual member states. However, all the parties \n\nconcerned ought to realise one thing. \nLeverage constructions increase the \nrisk for the taxpayer Œ the relationship\n between leverage and\n risk is one of", "Embargo: 4.00 pm CET on 20 October 2011\n  Page 9 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundes\nbank.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nthe first lessons from the financial cris\nis. What in any case must be rejected \nis a leveraging by granting the EFSF \na banking licence, which would allow \nthe EFSF to engage in Eurosystem re\nfinancing operations Œ in other words, \nto borrow directly from central ban\nks. For then, the Eurosystem would \nlargely be unable to shape monetary\n policy autonomously. Indeed, the \nEFSF would be able to generate a virt\nually unlimited flow of funds to the \ncapital markets and shift risks \naround between member states by \npurchasing large quantities of sovereign bonds. With that, the ban on \n\nmonetary state financing set forth in t\nhe EU treaties would be well and truly \nviolated. Overall, the question that presents itself is: how is a sanction mechanism Œ no \nmatter how severe Œ in the Stability and Growth Pact supposed to prevent \nunsound fiscal policy if\n threats of sanctions are m\nade, yet favourable conditions \nare lavished on a country that continuously disregards the rules? This is a question of fundamental importance to monetary union. Whether the \nanswer proves convincing \nwill depend on what appear \nto be purely technical \naspects of the solution, since they \ncan have unexpected implications. One \nexample concerns the choice of a trip\nle-A rating for the bonds with which the \nEFSF rescue fund borrows money on the \ncapital market for the assistance \nprogrammes. This top rating ought to remain intact as long as the borrowing by \n\nthe EFSF does not exceed the guarantee amo\nunt of the liable countries that are \ntriple-A rated. Thus, the effective \nlending volume currently amounts to •440 \nbillion. In connection with the call for addi\ntional funds for the EFSF, insistence \non this top rating for EFSF bonds leads\n, however, to the problematic leverage", "Embargo: 4.00 pm CET on 20 October 2011\n  Page 10 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundes\nbank.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nproposals I mentioned earlier. On the ot\nher hand, abandoning the triple-A rating \nwould also enable the EFSF to lift its l\nending volume. With regard to the EFSF \nin its present form, it was reported \nthat the lending volume of around •250 \nbillion could have been increased by just\n over half if an AA rating had been \naccepted instead of triple A. In contra\nst to a leveraging, however, the risk borne \nby the taxpayer would be lower if the \ntop rating were dispensed with. If the \nEFSF bonds had a somewhat lower rating, the effect would be to raise the \nEFSF™s funding costs somewhat. Howev\ner, these costs would be borne by the \ncountries receiving assistance. This would solve, at least in part, the problem \nentailed in loosening the conditions f\nor emergency loans and raise the incentive \nfor countries to return to the capital market under their own steam. \nTo sum up: in my view, strengthening t\nhe existing regulatory framework is a \nfeasible path towards stabilising monetary\n union. However, that\n will work only if \nthe rules are designed in such a way that\n they do not leave the door wide open \nfor misguided incentives. This applies in particular to the crisis mechanism Œ \nboth at the conceptual level and in terms of the technical implementation. All too \noften, the devil is in the detail, and \nwe cannot afford to make any mistakes \nthere. 4.2 Creating a fiscal union \nThe alternative, second path towards a stable monetary union is by way of a \nfiscal union. This would not automatically \nlead to a completely centralised fiscal \npolicy. But it would be important to set, at EU level, strict deficit and debt limits \n\nfor national budgets. These limits would \nthen apply at all national levels. In", "Embargo: 4.00 pm CET on 20 October 2011\n  Page 11 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundes\nbank.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \nGermany, this means central, state \nand local government and the social \nsecurity systems. The European rules \nwould have to be combined with \nappropriate powers of intervention, as on\nly then can the rules be effectively \nimplemented. If the national levels breac\nh the stipulated deficit and borrowing \nlimits, they would have to forfeit their \nfiscal sovereignty. The final decision-\nmaking powers over budgets would t\nhen no longer rest with the national \nparliaments but would be transferred to the European level. Ultimately, fiscal union would constitute \na consistent framework for the single \ncurrency, although to implement it woul\nd necessitate extensive changes to the \nEuropean treaties and national constitution\ns. As you can imagine, this route \nwould be a long one, and there is no te\nlling whether the people of the euro area \nwould support it. And to make one point quite clear: a fiscal union of this kind could, in principle, \nwork without joint liability. Although jo\nint liability could be introduced without much difficulty, it does not have to be. On no account Œ this is my firm belief Œ \nshould joint liability be introduced at this point in time in mere anticipation of \nfiscal union. This would be taking the second step before the first, and inevitably \n\nentail the risk of stumbling. Instead of \noffering a consistent solution, this would \nmean pursuing a middle path on which liability would be increasingly \ncommunitised while fiscal policy remain\ns a national responsibility. That path \nentails obvious contradictions; for this reason, the Deutsche Bundesbank \nrecommends we shun such an approach.", "Embargo: 4.00 pm CET on 20 October 2011\n  Page 12 of 12 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundes\nbank.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated. \n5 Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, we find ourselves in\n a situation in which difficult and, \nperhaps, uncomfortable decisions are unavoidable. This situation is aggravated \nby uncertainty in the markets and among the general public. This uncertainty \nhas to be eliminated if we want to break\n free of the present crisis. Yet this \nuncertainty cannot be eliminated by \nrepeatedly topping up the rescue fund. \nInstead, what we need are decisions \nwhich address the root causes of the \ncrisis. Besides a swift and ambitious fiscal \nconsolidation, I would highlight three \nmain points.  We need clarity regarding Greece™s future.\n Greece must fulfil the conditions \nof the aid programme; if it does not, \nthere is no basis for granting further \nsupport. A Greek default Œ which most \ncertainly no-one wishes to see Œ \ncannot therefore be categorically ruled out. \n We need clarity regarding the banking \nsector™s resilience. It has to be strengthened where it is too low in order to prevent contagion effects. This explicitly includes recapitalisations. \nThis is justified \neven though the banks are not to blame for the high level of sovereign debt in several European peripheral countries.  And we need clarity regarding the fu\nture of the monetary union. I have outlined two different paths in my \naddress. Which of the two paths is \nchosen is in the hands of our politicians. It is now up to them to decide quickly. We therefore expect clear a\nnd landmark decisions by the European \nCouncil this coming Sunday. \n*    *    *"], "SECTION": "reden", "RECORD_ID": 585}
