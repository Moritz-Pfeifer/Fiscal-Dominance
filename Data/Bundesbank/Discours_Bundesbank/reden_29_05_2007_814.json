Is there so\nmething special about monetary policy \ncompared with other fields of public policy? \n I want to highlight one aspect: Monet\nary policy is indeed \nremarkably different from other fields of public policy in\n that it is conducted by independent \ninstitutions. This is true of the euro area, but the independence of central banks is now a global phenomenon. Independen\nce means that monetary policy is \nshielded from the day-to-da\ny conflicts and power struggles that characterise \nother areas of policy.

Before I was appointed as President of\n the Bundesbank, I \nheld various tenures at German universities. My administrative \nexperience during most of that time \nwas limited to the often painful bure\naucratic duties and procedures that are \npart and parcel of life at German univers\nities.

It is my \nstaff that is finding the answers. \n Let me give you an example: In \nthe euro area, the relationship between \ngrowth, export performance and trade has \ngained much attention. I therefore \nwanted to know more about the facts and myths of this matter.  At the heart of the issue is the diverg\ning export perform\nance of Germany and \nFrance: Since 2000, Germany has been \nexperiencing a sharp rise in net \nexports. By contrast, net exports in F\nrance initially declined and then turned \nnegative in 2004. Similarly, the French def\nicit in bilateral Franco-German trade \nincreased considerably in the second \nhalf of the 1990s and is now between 1% and 1½% of French GDP.   This development is seen as worryi\nng by several French politicians: A \npreference for a weaker euro has been voiced time and again, partly as a \nconsequence of the recent election\n campaign, but evidently even more \nbecause of a different understanding of\n policy. It is always easy to find a \nscapegoat. For me as an economist, howev\ner, facts come first. So what \nexactly has caused the diff\nerence in export performance?  The traditional argument is that such differences can be explained by the \ngeographical and sectoral patt\nerns of trade specialisation.

However, in\n the period from 2001 to 2006, real \ndemand in German export markets did not\n grow significantly more strongly \nthan in French export markets: it \nwas, on average, a mere 0.3 pp higher. \nNevertheless, German firms outperform\ned French firms when it came to \nincreasing nominal exports of goods to\n almost all parts of the world. For \nexample, exports to the new EU member \nstates rose, on aver\nage, by 8.2% in \nGermany (compared with 3.3% in France).  As for the sectoral structure, no clear \ncompetitive advant\nage can be discerned \neither. Whereas France has a larger s\nhare in exporting consumer goods, \nGermany has a larger share \nin exports of cars, capita\nl goods and intermediate \ngoods. But since 2001, exports in all of\n these sectors (including consumer \ngoods) have been growing more dynamically in Germany than in France.  \n If the traditional analysis expl\nains very little in terms of\n the differences in export \nperformance, what else accounts for t\nhese differences? Are the worried voices right after all? No, they are not.  First of all, intra-euro-area trade is m\nore important for France than it is for \nGermany. In France, the share of exported goods to other EMU countries \namounted to 48% of all exports in 2005,\n whereas in Germany it was 5 pp \nlower.

Even more importantly, the wishful thin\nking behind a poli\ncy-driven weakening of the euro does not go to \nthe core of the problem. \nAll things considered, \ndifferences in export perf\normance are linked to difference\ns in competitiveness.  \nAs far as price competitiveness is concerned, it has increased in both Germany and France since the start of EMU. Bu\nt in Germany, the in\ncrease has been \nmore pronounced. One reason \nfor this has been wage policy moderation in \nGermany. In addition to that Œ and unlike French firms Œ German firms have \nboosted their competitiveness by incr\neasingly outsourcing their production \nprocesses to low-cost countries.  So, to some extent, the recent w\neakness of French ex\nport performance \ncompared to Germany can be explained \nby stronger gains in German price \ncompetitiveness.

M\noreover, French export firms are, on \naverage, smaller than German ones.   The upshot of this is that competit\niveness is enhanced by firms, not in \nexchange rate markets.
