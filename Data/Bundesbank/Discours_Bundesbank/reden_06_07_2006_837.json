I am pleased to welcome you to the \nthird conference \nof the Monetary \nStability Foundation here in Frankfurt. As in previous conferences, I am agai\nn very delighted that so many dis-\ntinguished speakers will share their \nthoughts with us during the forth-\ncoming panels. This year™s conference is entitled \nﬁChallenges to the financial system Œ \nageing and low growthﬂ. O\nne might ask: Why is this\n topic of interest to \nthe Monetary Stability F\noundation, whose aim is to maintain and pro-\nmote public awareness of the \nimportance of stable money? The reason is that maintaining the in\ntrinsic value of money requires that \nwe look not just at short-term dev\nelopments that have \na direct impact \non inflation dynamics; in fact, we al\nso need to closely monitor long-term \ndevelopments that might ultimately affect  - inflation - the transmission process of monetary policy \n- or financial market developments in general.", "Embargo: 6 July 2006, 3:00 pm local time \n  Page 3 of 10 \nLow growth and the ageing phenomenon \nare examples of such long-\nterm developments and therefore quite su\nitable topics for this year™s \nconference. During my opening address, I would like\n to outline the general topic of \nthe conference and its likely implications. In doing so, I hope to pave the \nway for the forthcoming panels that \nwill elaborate on several aspects in \nmore detail.  2  Ageing and low growth Œ interrelated phe-\nnomena and real economy implications If one were asked to rank the tw\no phenomena of ageing and low growth \nin order of public awareness in Eur\nope, low growth would most likely \ncome out ahead of ageing.  \nThe picture is quite clear: While the world economy continues to see \nstrong growth, the euro area™s econom\nic upswing remains by compari-\nson rather sluggish. A special matter of\n concern is the fact that not only \neuro area™s actual growth\n, but also its potential \ngrowth has visibly de-\nclined over the past few years.1 In parenthesis: This development stands\n in stark contrast to the objec-\ntives of the Lisbon Strategy, which \nwas especially developed to tackle \nlow productivity and low economic growth in the euro area!  \n Whereas the challenge of\n low growth is widely discussed, the phe-\nnomenon of ageing generally \ndoes not receive as much public attention. \nEvidently, it is very difficult to convince people and policy makers of the \n                                           \n 1  Average of the European Commission™s, IMF™s and OECD™s estimates for potential \noutput growth in the euro area over t\nhe years 1990-94: 2.4%\n. For 2005-06: 1.9%", "Embargo: 6 July 2006, 3:00 pm local time \n  Page 4 of 10 \nimportance of a phenomenon th\nat is emerging very \nslowly and is thus \nnot so obvious. Nevertheless, the economic repercu\nssions of a steadily ageing popula-\ntion are among the key economic and so\ncial policy challenges facing \nmodern industrial societies. There is undoubtedly considerable \nuncertainty about estimates regard-\ning the demographic developments over\n the next 50 years. Develop-\nments over the next 20 to 30 years,\n though, are comparatively easy to \nforecast. Therefore it would be highly re\nmiss of us not to take the core \nimplications of the currently available forecasts seriously. From an economic viewpoint, the \nlonger-term demographic problem is \nmostly attributable to the permanent \nshift in the age structure of the \npopulation and the relative contraction \nof the potential labour force. The \nshift in the age structure of the \npopulation has been evident for a long \ntime and is virtually irreversible. \nEven major adjustments in the birth \nrate or in migration movements woul\nd not suffice to halt the ageing \nprocess in the next two to three decades.  \nThis shift will negatively impact on social security systems as well as \npotential economic growth. Thus, the \nageing of society and low growth \nare not separate, but interrelated phenomena. \nRecent estimates expect ageing-induc\ned expenditures to rise signifi-\ncantly in the euro \narea by the year 2050.\n2 This will pose a dramatic \nthreat to the sustainabili\nty of the (already stretched) public finances of \nmost EMU member states. In addition,\n average potential growth is ex-\npected to decline sharply, \nfrom around 2% at present to slightly above \n1% (between 2031 and 2050).                                            \n 2  Economic Policy Committee and European Commission, The impact of ageing on \npublic expenditure, European Economy Special Report 1/2006. If projections for edu-\ncation expenditures and unemployment benefits \nare excluded, the increase in ageing-\ninduced spending amounts to 4.6% of euro-a\nrea GDP, ranging from 0.4% to over 10% \nof GDP for individual countries.", "Embargo: 6 July 2006, 3:00 pm local time \n  Page 5 of 10 \nBoth developments urgently call fo\nr adequate policy reactions. The \nchallenge is to find timely and appropriate economic and social policy \nanswers to the economic risks and bur\ndens resulting from demographic \nchange. In doing so, a key aim shoul\nd be to strengthen the foundations \nfor economic growth so that th\ne ﬁdemographic burdensﬂ can be ab-\nsorbed as much as possible. Therefor\ne, policy measures should aim at \nraising not only labour productivity but \nalso total factor productivity in \ngeneral.  The ongoing demographic change is not \nonly impacting directly on the \nreal economy. It is also putting so\ncial security systems under massive \npressure. Especially PAYGO pensi\non systems are being affected very adversely. A transition to fully\n-funded pension systems is an obvious \nnecessity in the medium to long term. Additionally, the demographic change is ve\nry likely to affect the financial \nsystem as well, namely: - economic and financial relationships  \n- the financial structure and \n\n- the effectiveness of monetary policy \n 3  Impact of demographic changes on the fi-\nnancial system  3.1 Ageing and financial returns \nLet me start with the impact of ageing\n on financial returns Œ or, to be \nmore precise, with its impact on real interest rates. Real interest rates \n\nare one of the most prom\ninent indicators used by central bankers, as \nthey reflect investors™ expectations about economic activity.", "Embargo: 6 July 2006, 3:00 pm local time \n  Page 6 of 10 \nAll other things equal, \ntheoretical and empirical \nstudies alike suggest a \ndecrease in real interest rates due to\n a higher capital-labour ratio. This \neffect would be amplified by a sh\nift from pay-as-you-go to funded pen-\nsion systems Œ which would be equiva\nlent to an increase in private \nsavings Œ and also by an allocation of\n funds to bonds. To what extent \nthe real interest rate is likely to\n decline is, however, the subject of \nheated debated. \n \nIn my view, only a slight decrease is \nto be expected. First of all, inte-\ngrated financial markets and internationally mobile capital should open \nup new ways of capital utilisation. Se\ncondly, the worst-case scenario of \nan asset meltdown (ie the assumption that the retiring baby-boomer \ngeneration will start dissaving, thus\n putting immense downward pres-\nsure on asset prices) is unlikely to \noccur: Not only does a longer life \nexpectancy imply higher individual savi\nng rates of workers, but retirees \nare also not expected to dissave Œ \nas would be assumed by the under-\nlying life-cycle model.3   3.2 Ageing and financial structure \n Apart from financial returns, ageing \nalso impacts on financial systems. \nThe large capital inflows into pensi\non funds and other institutionalised \nforms of saving since the 1990s have \nbeen the driving factor behind \nthis development.\n4 They reflect the noticeable increase in saving for re-\ntirement by the baby-boomer\n generation as well as the partial transition \nfrom pay-as-you-go to \nfunded pension schemes. In sum, these large \n                                           \n 3  For Germany, Axel Börsch-Supan states tha\nt, in the later stages of life, the saving \nratio stabilises at about 3% to 5% Œ a fa\nct which might be explained by lifetime un-\ncertainty and provision for old age (see \nA Börsch-Supan (2005), Risiken im Leben-\nszyklus Œ Theorie und Evidenz, Working Paper of the mea Œ Mannheimer For-\n\nschungsinstituts, No 069-05).\n 4  Even in Germany, where pay-as-you-go \nschemes and a bank-based financial sys-\ntem still prevail, the share of households™ fi\nnancial assets invested in mutual fund \nshares (accumulated with insurers and pension funds) has risen from 4% (1/5) in \n1991 to 12% (1/4) in 2005. At the same time, overall financial assets increased from \n\n•34,000 per household in 1991 to •69,000 in 2005.", "Embargo: 6 July 2006, 3:00 pm local time \n  Page 7 of 10 \ncapital inflows should accelerate the \nshift in EU financial systems from \na bank basis to a capital-market basis.   \nIn general, the transition to a more capital-market based financial sys-\n\ntem is expected to enhance financial \nstability. One prominent reason \nfor this effect is that the effici\nency, depth and liquidity of markets can \nbe assumed to improve with their grow\nth. In addition, the diversity in \ntypes and sizes of institutional invest\nors should increase. Finally, it is \nlikely that institutional \ninvestors will process in\nformation available to the \ngeneral public more efficiently than private investors.   \nAt this point, however, let me utte\nr two words of warning. They are \nnecessary as the growing importance \nof institutionalised forms of sav-\ning does not necessarily lead to increased stability.  \n Firstly, the rising number\n of institutional invest\nors could potentially be \naccompanied by a greater risk of her\nding behaviour which, in turn, \nmight increase volatility in financial markets. This is just one example \n\nwhy financial stability issues are at the top of central banks™ agendas.  \nThe second word of warning also \napplies to financial stability issues. \nThe transition from pay-as-you-\ngo schemes to funded pension \nschemes certainly supports fiscal sust\nainability Œ but introduces a new \nreason for concern: a dec\nline in the financial strength of suppliers. This \nrisk became apparent in 2000-02 when Œ \ndue to falling equity prices Œ \npension funds and also some life insu\nrance companies became signifi-\ncantly underfunded.  \n \nThe episode prompted policy changes in\n areas such as asset liability \nmanagement and financial accounting. \nHowever, the resultant need to \nmatch long-term liabilities with suitabl\ne assets might now trigger shifts \nin the asset allocation of pension funds and life insurers. Two ques-\n\ntions evolve out of that:", "Embargo: 6 July 2006, 3:00 pm local time \n  Page 8 of 10 \n1 Will there be a shift from\n equity to bond markets? Indeed, such a shift Œ or other in\nvestors™ (eg hedge funds) anticipa-\ntion of it Œ is commonly cited as \na ﬁspecial factorﬂ explaining what appear to be excessively low levels\n of global long-term interest \nrates. But even if such a shift is \nplausible in countries where equity \nallocation in the investment portfolio\ns predominates (for example, in \nthe US, the UK or Canada) empirica\nl evidence of such a closing of \nthe duration gap is neither clear nor uniform across countries.5  2 Is there a scarcity of financial \ninstruments that enable pension \nfunds and life insurers to manage \nduration, inflat\nion and longevity \nrisks? This is the reasoning underlying t\nhe occasional call for the govern-\nment to act as a catalyst for priv\nate issuance of inflation and longev-\nity hedges. I do not object to author\nities issuing ultr\na-long fixed and \ninflation-indexed bonds at market\n prices. But governments should \nrefrain from issuing \nlongevity bonds. Not only do governments lack \na suitable hedge for longevity risks, but Œ\n due to national pay-as-\nyou-go schemes Œ\n they already face a huge demographic burden \nwhich should not be exacerbated needlessly. \n 3.3 Ageing and monetary policy \nThe final question, ie the impact of\n ageing on monetary policy, is a re-\nsearch issue still in its infancy. T\nhe generally assumed \nimpact of a de-\nmographically-induced overall increase in savings is three-fold: \n Central banks will have to take \ninto account the gradual decline in \nreal interest rates (though its extent is hard to quantify).  The relative strength of the trans\nmission channels is likely to shift: \nwealth effects are likely to become \nmore important as the sensitivity \nof consumption and investment to a\nsset prices is expected to in-\ncrease.", "Embargo: 6 July 2006, 3:00 pm local time \n  Page 9 of 10 \n The pressure on central banks to\n keep inflation low and asset \nprices stable is expected to rise. \n \nAlthough the pace of demographic change\n is expected to be glacial Œ \nas already noted by Charles Bean, t\nhe chief economist of the Bank of \nEngland6 Œ it might be possible that its \neffects are slightly accelerated \nthrough a more rapid shift from \npay-as-you-go to funded pensions sys-\ntems. Indeed, research has shown t\nhat such a development supports \nthe shift to a more capital market-based financial system, thereby en-\n\nhancing households™ saving pr\nopensity and risk aversion.7  \nIn the same vein, we might ask ourse\nlves how the interrelationship be-\ntween increased private savings and the role of banks is going to de-\n\nvelop. As this interrelationship is \ncrucial to the transmission of mone-\ntary impulses, the following questions\n are worth answering. Will the im-\nportance of bank deposits shrink, and \nwhat would be the implications? \nTo what extent will \nbank and bond market financing be substitutes? \nAnd how readily will banks be able to adapt to their ever-changing en-\nvironment? I hope that these issues mi\nght capture researchers™ curios-\nity. They are of particular intere\nst in the euro area, where bank-\ndominated financial systems still prevail.  To sum it up, the Eurosystem will increasingly need to monitor demog-\nraphically-induced changes\n in the financial system. Based on these in-\nsights, the Eurosystem will prov\nide a stable, non-inflationary \nmacroeconomic environment Œ which is\n the best contribution to eco-\nnomic growth it can and does make.                                                                                                                        \n 5 See OECD (2006), Pension fund demand for \nhigh-quality long-term bonds: Quantify-\ning potential scarcity of suitable instrument\ns, in: Financial Market Trends, April 2006.\n 6  See C Bean (2004), Global demographic chan\nge: some implications for central banks, \nOverview Panel, FRB Kansas City Annual\n Symposium, Jackson Hole, Wyoming. \n7  See D Miles and A \nerný (2006), Risk, return and portfo\nlio allocation under alternative \npension systems with incomplete and imperfect financial markets, in: The Economic \nJournal, April 2006.", "Embargo: 6 July 2006, 3:00 pm local time \n  Page 10 of 10 \n4 Concluding remarks \nTo stimulate our panel discussions, I \nhave highlighted some examples of \nhow ageing, low growth and financial \nsystems interrelate.
