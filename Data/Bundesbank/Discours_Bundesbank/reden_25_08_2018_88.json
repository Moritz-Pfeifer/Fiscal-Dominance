The post\n-war period was characterized by tightly regulated banks and \nlimited competiti\non. A second period, roughly between the 1980s and the global \nfinancial crisis, featured deregulation and increasing competition across activities \nand borders. In the third, post\n-crisis period, a comprehensive reform agenda has \nbeen initiated with the aim \nof enhancing the resilience of the financial system. \nRaising capital requirements, reducing too\n-big\n-to-fail \nsubsidies\n and reforms of the \nshadow banking system are its core elements. Such reforms are designed to \nenhance the resilience of the financial syste\nm, and they affect also the competitive \nstructure of markets. Looking ahead, competition through new technologies and \nnew market entrants will pose a challenge to incumbent financial institutions.\n The banking\n industry is thus going through a phase of \nsignificant structural \nchange, which raises a number of questions: Has the concentration of banking \nmarkets increased, and has competition declined, and what are the implications for \nstability? To what extent are these trends driven by post\n-crisis regulato\nry reforms? \nHave non\n-viable banks exited the market? How effective is macroprudential \npolicy? How can policy support banks™ adjustment to structural change without \nhaving adverse effects on the efficiency and stability of the system?  What do new \ntechnolog\nies imply for the efficiency\n-stability trade\n-off? There is a large body of \nempirical and theoretical literature on the efficiency\n-stability (or risk\n-return) trade\n-off, but the findings are rather inconclusive (Carletti 2008).\n Assessing trends in competitio\nn and their interaction with policy measures requires \na framework that allows an analysis of the link between competition and stability. \nCorbae and Levine (2018) explicitly model the dynamic response of banking \nsystems to various policy measures through ma\nrket entry and exit of banks.

And \nthey analyze policy implications, stressing interactions of policies (capital \nrequirements, regulation of compensation, monetary policy).\n The paper has an impor\ntant message: More competition can yield a ﬁdouble \ndividendﬂ in terms of efficiency and stability \nŒ but only if accompanied by good \npolicy design. Policy interventions are needed: More intense competition alone \nenhances efficiency \nŒ but also increases frag\nility. Also, monetary policy is more \neffective in more competitive markets with compressed margins.\n My comments focus on three questions: Does the model match key stylized facts? \nWhat are the implications for policy?

Banking crises were rare (Kaminsky and Reinhart 1999). \nBanking was ﬁboringﬂ (Krugman \n2009), as reflected in the structure of skills and \ncompensation systems (Philippon and Reshef 2012). \n Decomposing the valuation of bank equity prices shows that, between 1970 and \n1985, franchise values of US banks were not high, market\n-to-book values of ba\nnk \nequity were closely aligned, and estimates of implicit government guarantees were \nsmall (Atkeson, d™Avernas, Eisfeldt, and Weill 2018).\n Phase 2:\n Deregulation and Increasing Competition\n Deregulation of banking markets started in the 1980s. In the US, the\n Riegle\n-Neal \nAct of 1994 and the Gramm\n-Leach\n-Bliley Act of 1999 allowed banks to expand \nacross state lines and into new types of business. ﬁRegulation Qﬂ, imposing \nrestrictions on deposit rates and incentivizing households to resort to Money \nMarket Funds, \nwas relaxed beginning in the mid\n-1980s.\n 2  In Europe, the First \nBanking Directive of 1977 allowed banks to establish branches in other member \nstates. \nThe Second Banking Directive of 1989 \nopened \nup capital markets across \nEuropean countries. \n Deregulation\n, market entry, and technological change \nramped up\n competiti\nve \npressure\n. Deregulation \nmay have been in the intere\nst of banks \nin terms of \nopening \nup new markets\n. Eventually\n, however\n, deregulation\n may have been \nsel\nf-defeating\n as\n it eroded margins\n and increased incentives\n to take risks\n.

Yet, it soon became evident that some business models were \nbeing affected more in structural terms and that many banks were, in fact, facing \nsolvency problems. At the macroeconomic level, several shocks interacted, \ncausing a m\nacroeconomic crisis with the ensuing decline in credit demand, and, in \nsome regions, a sovereign debt crisis.\n4  Initial structural conditions \nŒ including the degree of competition \nŒ had an impact \non banks™ adjustment to the new environment. Some banking \nsystems had already \nmanifested weaknesses in capitalization or profitability prior to the crisis. The \nmargins of German banks, for example, had been under pressure well before the \ncrisis (Hellwig 2018a). Reactions to the crisis were thus heterogeneous acro\nss \nbanks and countries. Many banks consolidated their international operations. \nOther banks were not heavily exposed to the most turbulent markets and were \nthus not affected much by the initial shock. Some banks had strong capital buffers \nand seized the op\nportunity to expand into new markets.\n5 Overall, the crisis \nappears to have precipitated a reallocation of market shares away from weaker \nbanks \nto stronger \nbanks\n.  Policy responses differed as well, reflecting the need for intervention and \nthe \navailable \nins\ntitutional frameworks for dealing with \nbank \ndistress\n.

At the international level, the \nG20 \nleaders \nagreed\n, in 2009\n, on a set of reforms that \nreduce frictions and risk\n-taking incentives.\n 6 These reforms affect and, to some \nextent, operate through the competitive structure of banking markets: (i) \nEnhancing \nresilience:\n More stringent capital requirements, as a core reform element, shift \nactivities towards well\n-capitalized banks. (ii) \nEnding t\noo big\n-to-fail: Policies aimed \nat reducing implicit subsidies for systemically important financial institutions affect \nthe market power of banks strongly reliant on such subsidies.

The theoretical part of the paper has a \nnumber \nof relevant features\n:   Risk-return \ntrade\n-off\ns: Banks fund projects that use a \ntechnology \nwhich \nincorporates a risk\n-return \ntrade\n-off\n Œ riskier projects have higher returns.\n9 This feeds into the riskiness of banks: bank managers choose the scale of \ntheir operations (\nby competing for \ndeposits) and the riskiness of their assets \n(projects). Future profits (rents) constitute franch\nise value. This should lead \nbank managers \nto be cautious. But more intense competition also erodes \nfuture rents, lowers franchise value, and increases incentives to take risks.\n Managers receive a variable compensation as a fixed fraction of profits.\n  Frictions\n: Compared to the central planner™s solution, the competitive market \noutcome leads to excessive risk\n-taking because of two sources of moral \nhazard. The first concerns the interaction between managers and \nshareholders.  \nManagers \nhave\n an objective f\nunction in which future \ndividends are discounted \nwith\n the discount factor\n . Managers \nare myopic\n and more impatient than shareholders who discount future dividends with a \ndiscount factor \n,: \n.

Causal \nIdentification\n Just as the theoretical predictions on the competition\n-stability nexus are not \nclear\n-cut, the \nvast body of empirical work on the \ncompetition\n-stability\n trade\n-off\n for banks\n does not reach a definite conclusion \n(Carletti \n2008\n, Freixas and Ma 2014\n). Simply \nobserving\n that the riskiness of banks increased following deregulation does not \ntell\n us \nwhether deregulation has \ncaused\n greater risks. Similarly, causal identification is \nneeded when assessing the effects of other policy measures discussed in the \npaper.\n The empirical work in \nCorbae and Levine\n (2018) \nbuilds on \nJiang, Levine, and Lin \n(2018) \nwho \nargue that earlier literature studying the \ncompetition\n-stability\n trade\n-off\n for banks does not properly account for exogenous changes in bank competition.\n12 They \nuse \nan identification approach which combines information on \nthe \nderegulation of bank entry across US states with information on pre\n-existing \nstructures of bank holding companies\n. They \nconstruct a bank\n-specific, exogenous\n, proxy\n for \nthe degree of \ncompetition\n: the competitive pressure faced by each bank\n holding company is calculated by using the distance between its subsidiaries and \nstates which deregulate entry. This measure differs across banks and time, \nwhich \nallows \nboth state\n-year and bank fixed effects \nto \nbe included in the empirical model. \nThis identification can be used to test the implications of the model concerning \nchanges in competition but not \nŒ as stated by the authors \nŒ implications \nconcerning other polic\ny measures.\n Risk is measured using the standa\nrd deviation of daily stock returns and market\n-based measures of systemic risk. \nThe proxy used in this paper\n, the ﬁimportance of \ninstitutional investors\n,ﬂ follows a small previous literature (O'Brien and Bhushan \n1990; Freudenberg, Imbierowicz, Saunders, \nand \nSteffen 2017).\n Using th\nese\n measure\ns, Corbae and Levine (2018) \nfind that competition reduces \nbank\ns™ profit margins and \ncharter value\ns.

In 2017, the FSB developed a \nframework for the ex post assessment of financial regulatory reforms\n (FSB 2017)\n. The framework has three main objectives: (i) causal impact assessment \n(attribution), (ii) identification of relevant heterogeneities across countries, financial \ninstitutions, and reform areas, \nand \n(iii) identification of general equilibrium effects. \nThe FSB framework focuses on empirical methodologies.\n Changes in the competitive structure of banking markets are a key channel \nthrough which \nthe reforms affect resilience. Assessing the effects of reforms thus \nrequires a conceptual framework which links competition and stability in a dynamic \nsetting. \nCorbae \nand Levine (2018) provide \nelements of \nsuch \na \ncomplementary \nframework\n: short\n-term versus long\n-term effects, effects of policy packages, \nintended and unintended effects of reforms\n.

Generally, tighter leverage requirements reduce \nrisk-taking, and these effects are more pronounced in more competitive markets \nand when banks are better governed. These interactions and potential non\n-linearities \nneed to be taken into account when assessing the effects of leverage \nrequirements.\n 3 Comment 1\n: Does the Model Match Key Stylized Facts\n? The empirical analysis of the paper is confined to the US. \nResults are based on \nCall Report data, which are used to match\n empirical and theoretical moments. \nTh\ne focus on US data\n raises the question \nof the \nextent \nto which \nthe stylized facts and \nthe empirical results generalize beyond the US.\n The following figures show trends \nin banking systems across G7 countries since the early 2000s.\n14  While banking systems are better capitalized than they used to be, time trends in \nterms of market structure and competition differ across countries. This is \nnot \nsurprising, given differences in initial conditions, different policy responses, and \ndifferent shocks. Applying the insights of the model to different countries would \nthus be an interesting avenue for future work.\n a.\n Activities of \nBanks\n In terms of the sh\nare of banking system assets relative to total assets of the \nfinancial system, the US financial system is not very representative \nof the \nG7. \nBanking system assets are less important in the US (about 20% of total assets) \ncompared to European countries (abou\nt 60\n-70% of assets) (\nFigure\n 1).", "Seite \n13 von \n32 Deutsche Bundesbank, Zentralbereich \nKommunikation\n Wilhelm\n-Epstein\n-Straße 14, 60431 Frankfurt am Main, Tel: 069 9566 3511 oder 3512, Fax: 069 9566 3077\n presse@bundesbank.de, www.bundesbank.de\n  Bei publizistischer Verwertung wird um Angabe der Quelle gebeten.\n Zooming in on the banking system alone, the US looks more similar to other G7 \ncountries\n, with about 50% of assets being loans (\nFigure\n 1).\n Out of \ntotal \nloans, \nabout 38% in the US and 27% in the \neuro \narea are loans to business \nŒ about one \nquarter are housing loans.\n15 Focusing on \ncorporate\n loans in the theoretical model \nthus captures a relevant part of banks™ activities\n, and it would be interesting to \ndiscuss whether analyzing mortgages that often\n grow dy\nnamically \nand trigger \nfinancial stability risks\n would change the overall message of the paper\n.  In future work\n, it would be interesting to \nsee\n which of the implications of the model \nare driven by the specific assumptions on the \nmodelling of competition and \nfrictions. For example, Corbae and Levine (2018) assume imperfect competition on \nthe liability side (competition for deposits) but asset demand (the projects) is \ninfinite for any quality level.  Corbae and D™Erasmo (2018), in c\nontrast, assume \nthat there is imperfect competition for loans.  Also, maturity transformation and \nmodeling the wholesale funding market may matter\n, in particular\n, for other G7 \ncountries\n, where the share of deposit funding for banks is lower than in the US \n(Figure\n 1)\n. These features \nmight be \nimportant for the analysis of capital \nrequirements. For example, \nMankart, Michaelides and Pagratis (\nforthcoming\n) show \nthat \na tightening of capital requirements has stronger effects on bank failures for \nsmall banks than f\nor large banks because small banks have less access to \nwholesale funding markets\n. Generally, modelling liquidity risk could be an \ninteresting extension of the model (Carletti 200\n8, Carletti and Leonello 2018).\n b. Competition\n The model is calibrated assuming a \nrather high \ndegree of concentration of 1/\nN = 0.33 or \nN = 3 at the state level\n as a benchmark\n.

Such externalities \nare insufficiently accounted for by individ\nual market participants. Macroprudential \nsupervision thus complements microprudential supervision (and monetary policy). \n Generally, the link between competition and financial stability depends on the \nnature of the shock and risk\n-taking incentives at the l\nevel of the individual firm.\n18 In \na highly concentrated banking system, in which a few banks dominate, an \nidiosyncratic shock hitting a large financial institution can have repercussions for \nthe entire system (granularity effects or ﬁtoo big to failﬂ).\n19 But\n a decentralized and \nweakly \ncompetitive \nbanking system \npopulated by \nmany small banks \nmay have \ndestabilizing\n features as well\n.

Policy measures \nwhich reduce \nmyopic behavior can \nreduce \nexcessive risk\n-taking. \nMoreover, policy measures\n interact: lowering barriers \nto competition \nand\n improving\n private governance \nmechanisms \ncan be welfare \nimproving. \n Managerial incentives \ncertainly \nmatter for individual institutions\n™ risk-taking\n, and, \nultimately, financial stability.\n20 Yet, whether and, if so, which restrictions on \nmanagement compensation enhance financial stability is difficult to assess for \nthree reasons. \n First, it would be interesting to analyze in more detail why private contracts w\nould \nfail to address the model™s agency problems and why policy interventions are \nwarranted. In principle, the incentives of owners and managers could be aligned \nthrough private contracts.\n21  Yet, such \ncontracts may fail to internalize systemic \nrisk externalities.\n Second, g\nuidelines for compensation models may\n be interpreted as\n a regulatory \nﬁapprovalﬂ of certain contractual features or governance mechanism\ns.

König, \nJochen Mankart, Felix Noth, Esteban Prieto, Katheryn Russ, and Benjamin Weigert for most helpful discussions on and contribut\nions \nto an earlier draft. All errors and inconsistencies are my own.\n 2 In the US, the number of new banks entering the market decli\nned from more than 100 annually between 1990 and 2008 to fewer than two in the period 2009 through 2013 (Adams and Gramlich 2\n014).  The authors attribute most of this decline to \nweak macroeconomic conditions and low interest rates.\n 3 For early discussions \nof systemic risk, see Borio (2003), Crocket (1997), or Hellwig (1998). \n 4 See Shambough (2012) for an analysis of the European case.\n 5 Buch and Goldberg (2017) summarize evidence from the International Banking Research Network (IBRN) on the cross\n-border sp\nillovers of prudential policies. These results show a significant degree of heterogeneity, including the reallocation of \nmarket shares across banks and countries.\n 6 See the declaration of the Pittsburgh Summit in 2009: http://www.fsb.org/wp\n-content/uploads\n/g20_leaders_declaration_pittsburgh_2009.pdf\n 7 See Bolton and Oehmke (2018) for a theoretical analysis of resolution strategies (multiple versus single point of entry) for \nglobal banks.  \n 8 See the 2017 FSB Report ﬁFinancial Stability Implications from Fin\nTechﬂ (http://www.fsb.org/2017/06/financial\n-stability\n-implications\n-from\n-fintech/).\n 9 Entrepreneurs are not explicitly modeled. In that sense, banks do not intermediate funds between savers and investors, and th\nere is no risk diversification across entrepre\nneurs. \n 10\n The income of households, for example, is exogenous.\n 11\n For theoretical models supporting this mechanism, see Allen and Gale (2004), Hellmann, Murdock, and Stiglitz (2000), Keeley (\n1990), Matutes and Vives (2000), or Wagner (2010)", "Seite \n32 von \n32 Deutsche Bundesbank, Zentralbereich \nKommunikation\n Wilhelm\n-Epstein\n-Straße 14, 60431 Frankfurt am Main, Tel: 069 9566 3511 oder 3512, Fax: 069 9566 3077\n presse@bundesbank.de, www.bundesbank.de\n  Bei publizistischer Verwertung wird um Angabe der Quelle gebeten.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     12\n A related pape\nr by Goetz, Laeven, and Levine (2016) finds that banks which are more geographically diversified have lower risk.\n 13\n Identification in this paper is based on the fact that entry restrictions (capital requirements) changed in response to exoge\nnous, decennial\n census results.\n 14\n The following data has been compiled in the context of the BIS Report titled ﬁStructural changes in banking after the crisisﬂ\n. For details, see \nhttps://www.bis.org/publ/cgfs60.htm\n. Due \nto differences in data definition across countries, the evolution of \nindicators across time is more informative than the interpretation of levels of indicators across countries.\n 15\n These data are for 2016 and are taken from the CGFS database.\n 16\n On the inter\npretation of bank capital and profitability, see also Admati and Hellwig (2014). \n 17\n This is reminiscent of a decline in payments into deposit insurance. One interesting question is whether the central bank wou\nld be able to control the real costs of funds p\nermanently.\n 18\n Likewise, the link between financial contagion and the connectedness of financial institutions is non\n-linear (Allen and Gale 2000; Gai, Haldane, and Kapadia 2011).\n 19\n These granularity effects have been shown by Gabaix (2011) for the manufactu\nring industry. Applications to banking markets include Amiti and Weinstein (forthcoming) and Bremus, Buch, Russ, and Schnitze\nr (forthcoming).  \n 20\n For the US, there is evidence that risk\n-taking and variable pay increased after deregulation in the 1990s (DeY\noung, Peng, Yan 2013).\n 21\n See, for instance, the discussion in Bebchuk and Fried (2003) or the literature reviewed in Colonnello, Koetter, and Wagner (\n2018).\n 22\n See the European Commission™s Banking Communication 2013, position 7: ﬁFinancial stability remain\ns of central importance in the Commission's assessment of state aid to the financial sector under this Communication.ﬂ Art. 1\n07(3)b.\n 23\n BRRD, Art. 32(4)d: [an institution shall be deemed failing or likely to fail if] ﬁextraordinary public financial support \nis required except when, in order to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State and preserve financial sta\nbility \n[–].ﬂ 24\n Carlson, Correia, and Luck (2018) find evidence in favor of this hypothesis when studying the response of incumbent \nbanks in the US to deregulation as the result of an exogenous event.\n 25\n See Buch, Bussière, Goldberg, and Hills (forthcoming) for a summary of a large set of country\n-level studies using bank\n-level data to identify the transmission of monetary policy into le\nnding.\n 26\n This classification system for academic literature in economics is based on the Journal of Economic Literature.
