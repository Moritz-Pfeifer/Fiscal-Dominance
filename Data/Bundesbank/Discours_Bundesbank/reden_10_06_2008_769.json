Some of you probably know that I worked as a pro-fessor of economics at various German \nuniversities before I became President of the Bundesbank. As a professor, I us\ned to dig rather deeply into economic \nissues related to both international economics and monetary policy and shared \nthe insights I gained with my students in lectures and seminars. As a policy-\n\nmaker, however, my public speeches now\n often focus on the outlook for cur-\nrent monetary policy in the Eurosystem. \nThus, as a side effect of my change of\n direction from being an academic to \nbecoming a policymaker, the subject \nmatter delivered in my public appear-\nances has narrowed somewhat to mid-term\n inflation and economic outlooks. \nGiven that I still like to talk about m\nore fundamental issues in my speeches \nfrom time to time, I welcome occasions \nsuch as this lecture in which I can \nshed greater light on a more bas\nic feature of monetary policy.", "Embargo: 10 June 2008, 5.30 pm local time\n  Page 3 of 25 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nOver the next 45 minutes or so, I shall mainly be elaborating on the nature and role of macroeconomic projections in monet\nary policy.

Before I talk about macroeconomic projecti\nons in greater detail, I would like to \nstart my remarks by bringing to mind t\nhe basic state of monetary policy in \ngeneral and of Eurosystem monet\nary policy in particular. \n 2 The current state of (European) monetary policy \nOver the past few decades, a well-founded consensus has emerged about the \nnature of sound monetary policy. It \ncomprises two key elements.  First, the agreement that inflation should be low and stable. The rationale be-\nhind this low-inflation paradigm is that\n price stability reduces the degree of \neconomic uncertainty, and, therefore, facilitates the efficient allocation of re-\nsources in an economy. In addition to \nthis key benefit, maintaining price stabil-\nity also minimises other negative effects \nthat accompany infl\nation, such as un-", "Embargo: 10 June 2008, 5.30 pm local time\n  Page 4 of 25 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nintentional effects on the distribution of income and wealth. Hence, maintaining \nprice stability is, and should \nbe, a central bank™s prim\nary objective because it \nis the best way in which monetary polic\ny can contribute to economic stability, \neconomic prosperity and job creation. \nSecond, the clear assignment of respons\nibility for inflation to an independent \ncentral bank. Undisputedly, independenc\ne is an exceptional privilege granted \nto only a few institutions in democratic\n societies. Howev\ner, the independence \nof modern central banks is not an end in itself. Rather, central bank independ-\n\nence helps to maintain a long-term stab\nility orientation of monetary policy by \ninsulating decision-making bodies from \nshort-termist political influence. Put \nbriefly, an independent cent\nral bank is in the interes\nts of the general public. \nCentral bank independence assists in \nenhancing monetary policy™s credibility \nand its effectiveness, which can be measure\nd by inflation expectations, for in-\nstance. The role of inflation expect\nations, in particular, has at\ntracted a lot of attention \nover the past decade and it has becom\ne a key element of modern monetary \npolicy and the related field of research. The reason for this is that inflation ex-\n\npectations are now considered to play a ce\nntral role in the transmission proc-\ness of monetary policy, as it has become evident that expected future inflation \nis a crucial determinant of actual future inflation. \nSome observers see this as absolutely \ncritical. Michael Woodford, for exam-\nple, a highly renowned US-based researcher,\n even put it as follows: ﬁNot only \ndo expectations about policy matter, but, \nat least under current conditions,", "Embargo: 10 June 2008, 5.30 pm local time\n  Page 5 of 25 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nvery little else matters.ﬂ \nIn other words, steering in\nflation expectations has now \nbecome an important Œ or even th\ne most important Œ lev\ner for central banks in \npursuing price stability. Not very long ago, many central banks w\nere very opaque instit\nutions from an \noutsider™s point of view. By contras\nt, transparency has now become a key ele-ment in the design of modern monetary pol\nicy. The reason for this is twofold. \nOn the one hand, there is the principle of\n democratic accountability according \nto which an independent central bank Œ since \nit is not even indirectly subject to \nelectoral accountability Œ must be trans\nparent in order to gi\nve the public the \nopportunity to see whether monetary policymakers are fulfilling their mandate. On the other hand, monetary policy t\nransparency and monetary policy effec-\ntiveness are positively correlated. Basicall\ny, at least to a \ncertain degree, the \nmore transparent monetary policy is, the \nmore effective it becomes in main-\ntaining price stability. The reason for this\n is that transparency makes it possi-\nble for market participants to better \nunderstand both the c\nentral bank™s objec-\ntive and its strategy and, hence, enables \nthem to better anticipate the future \nmonetary policy course. In turn, this\n reduces uncertainty among market par-\nticipants and the public and helps to anc\nhor inflation expecta\ntions at a level \nconsistent with the central bank™s inflation target. \nThere are four crucial elements that c\nontribute to a transparent monetary pol-\nicy. First, a clear definition of the ultimate goal, that is a quantitative price sta-\nbility target. Second, t\nhe announcement of a cohe\nrent and robust monetary \npolicy strategy.

Finally, the immediate and consis\ntent explanation, justification and \npublication of policy decisions. \nThe Eurosystem™s monetary policy follows these guiding principles very \nclosely. With respect to the first point Œ \nthe definition of the ultimate goal Œ the \nEurosystem™s primary objectiv\ne is to maintain price st\nability, as stipulated in \nthe Treaty establishing the European Community. Since the Treaty itself does \nnot give a precise operational definition of \nwhat is actually meant by the term \nﬁprice stabilityﬂ, we on the ECB™s Governing Council define it as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of\n Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro \narea of below, but close to 2%. Taking in\nto account the existence of long time-\nlags in the transmission of monetary polic\ny, price stability is to be maintained \nin the medium term. While the definition of price stability is the first step in establishing a transpar-\nent monetary policy, the Governing Counc\nil™s policy decisions are based on an \nexplicit, publicly announced monetary po\nlicy strategy. The Eurosystem™s ap-\nproach to organising, evaluating and cross-\nchecking the information relevant \nto assessing the risks to price stab\nility is based on two complementary per-\nspectives, known as the ﬁtwo pillar-strategyﬂ. In this context, the first perspective ai\nms to assess the s\nhort to medium-term \ndeterminants of price developments, with \na focus on real activity and financial \nconditions in the economy.

This perspective, the first \npillar, is the ﬁeconomic analysisﬂ. \nThe second perspective or \npillar Œ the ﬁmonetary ana\nlysisﬂ Œ focuses on a \nlonger-term horizon, exploiting the lo\nng-run link between money and changes \nin the general price level. The monetary \nanalysis serves mainly as a means of \ncross-checking, from a medium to lon\ng-term perspective, the short to medium-\nterm implications for monetary policy stemming from the economic analysis. \nAs regards the third and fourth point of\n a transparent monetary policy Œ the \npublication of the data relevant to m\nonetary policy decisions and the substan-\ntiation of these decisions Œ the Euros\nystem™s communication policy is very ad-\nvanced as well. For instance, the mont\nhly decisions on key interest rates and \ntheir underlying reasoning are explained in\n detail to the public by the ECB \nPresident in a press confer\nence that directly follows the meeting of the Gov-\nerning Council. Furthermore, media representatives have the opportunity to \n\npose their questions to the ECB Pres\nident in the subsequent Q&A session. Taken together, the Eurosystem™s monetar\ny policy framework is transparent, \nand monetary policy decisions are explain\ned to the public both in great depth \nand in real time. Notwithstanding all these elements of a \nﬁstate of the artﬂ monetary policy, \nsome observers, in particular from t\nhe English-speaking world, have repeat-\nedly called into question the European \nmonetary policy framework and have \ndoubted its clarity.", "Embargo: 10 June 2008, 5.30 pm local time\n  Page 8 of 25 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nThese critics claim that European monetary policy is not sufficiently transpar-\nent, and therefore sends out misleading \nsignals, especially regarding the fu-\nture course of key interest rates.

Why is this so? The main reason \nfor this is that monetary policy measures\n affect the econom\ny only after a long, variable und uncertain time lag. A st\nability-oriented monet\nary policy should therefore not merely respond to\n actual data on inflat\nion and the real economy. \nRather, it should act in a pre-emptive m\nanner and, in turn, should not wait for \nrisks to price stability to materialise. Metaphorically speaking, obviously, a \nstability-oriented monetary policy cannot \nbe conducted by looking through the rear-view mirror Œ in other words, by fo-\ncusing on past inflation and real ec\nonomic data. Moreover, \nlooking through the \nside window Œ that is relying primarily\n on current observations of growth and \ninflation Œ is not sufficient either, since the long and variable lags of monetary \npolicy transmission mean that today™s \ninflation can no longer be influenced by current monetary policy decisions.

Therefore, (at least implicit) forecasts for inflation and real GDP growth are \ntools used by most central banks \nnowadays for assessing the appropriateness \nof the current monetary poli\ncy stance. In this cont\next, three particular ques-tions arise: ﬁWhat are the specific c\nharacteristics of economic forecasts?ﬂ, \nﬁHow can these characteristics be conv\neyed to the general public?ﬂ, and ﬁHow \ncan monetary policy make use of macroeconomic projections?ﬂ \n3.1 Central forecast and uncertainty \nEspecially with respect to the first two questions, I do not want to go into too \nmany mathematical details regarding forecasting techniques, as this would \nmake my remarks a highly technical presentation. I would prefer to concen-\ntrate instead on the fundamental and most\n important elements of forecasting.  So, where to start if one \nwants to generate a forecast?\n As we are living in an \never-changing economic environment, the st\narting point of every forecast is a \nset of forward-looking assumptions, at l\neast with respect to main economic \nvariables such as future market interest\n rates, exchange rates, crude oil prices \nand both world trade and growth.

So far, so good. Up to now, this has\n been relatively easy to understand, but \nthis is not the end of the forecasting \nprocess. A key consideration to bear in \nmind is that point forecasts do not a\nllow the proper quantification and commu-\nnication of two very import\nant aspects of a forecas\nt, namely uncertainty and risk. Uncertainty and risk are two different th\nings. I am therefore going to cover \nthem separately. Let me first elaborate \non the issue of unc\nertainty before look-ing more closely at the issue of risk. \nKenneth Wallis, a researcher who has been working a lot on forecasting is-\nsues, rightly points out that ﬁit is now widely recognised that a point forecast \n\n[central projection] is seldom sufficien\nt for well-informed decision-making in the \nface of an uncertain future, and that it needs to be supplemented with an indi-\ncation of the degree of uncertainty.ﬂ In other words, even thoug\nh the baseline scenario presented is to be regarded \nas the most likely development given t\nhe assumptions made, it is subject to \nuncertainties since actual future deve\nlopments may deviate from the expected \ndevelopments as reflected in the point forecast.", "Embargo: 10 June 2008, 5.30 pm local time\n  Page 12 of 25 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nThe greater the difference between the point forecast \nand the subsequent ac-\ntual realisation of the forecast variables is on average, the more uncertain is \n\nthe forecast. Conversely, if the average dev\niation is low, this indicates that the \nforecasts are comparatively secure. What are the actual causes of t\nhe more or less high degree of uncertainty \nwhen generating macroeconomic forecasts? Five sources of forecasting un-\ncertainty and possible causes of forec\nast errors can be distinguished.  \nFirst, the model used for forecasting can \ndiffer from the actual macroeconomic \nprocess, a fact called ﬁmodel uncertainty\nﬂ. Models generally describe the mac-\nroeconomic process at a very high degree\n of abstraction and aggregation and \nthus necessarily conceal some of the \ncomplexities of economic processes or \nconfine the account to certain element\ns which are deemed characteristic. For \nthe forecast, it is assumed that the \nrelationships considered in the model are \nof sufficient relevance and will remain valid over the forecasting horizon.  Second, the starting values on which a \nforecast is based can be tentative and \nthus subject to future statistical revisions\n. This is known as ﬁdata uncertaintyﬂ.  Third, estimates are also necessary \nfor the exogenous variables in the model, \nand these can be fraught with\n errors. This is term\ned ﬁexogenous uncertaintyﬂ. \nThe development in oil prices and capita\nl market rates used\n for the forecasts \nare classic examples of this.", "Embargo: 10 June 2008, 5.30 pm local time\n  Page 13 of 25 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nFourth, it can be expected that a number \nof non-systematic disruptions will oc-\ncur during the forecast period. These \nﬁstochastic shocksﬂ cannot be foreseen \nowing to their incidental nature but are \ntemporarily able to influence, more or \nless strongly, the underlying relationshi\nps between the economically relevant \nvariables. This phenomenon is referred \nto as ﬁresidual uncertaintyﬂ. For in-\nstance, unusual weather co\nnditions can temporarily \nhave a stronger impact on \nvalue added than in the usual seasonal pa\nttern, particularly in the construction \nindustry.  Finally, estimation of the model parameters is also subject to uncertainty as \nsamples of only a limited size are ava\nilable and the data used can be fraught with errors. This is called ﬁestimation uncertaintyﬂ.  \nThe various sources of forecasting\n uncertainty are not\n generally independent \nof each another. They can be mutually \nreinforcing but may also offset each \nother. It is thus conceivable, for exampl\ne, that an underestimation of the euro™s \nexchange rate against the US dollar w\nill go some way towards ﬁcorrectingﬂ an \nunderestimation of the dollar price of import\ned crude oil in terms of the effect \non domestic prices. Being aware of the various sources of un\ncertainty associated with point fore-\ncasts is essential for a sensible use \nthese projections, but this does not an-\nswer the question of how to actually pu\nt a figure on the degree of uncertainty. \nNot surprisingly, the precise extent of the forecasting uncertainty is unknown \nand has to be estimated. One procedure is to carry out stochastic simulations", "Embargo: 10 June 2008, 5.30 pm local time\n  Page 14 of 25 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nwith a model. However, such simulations\n can hardly account fo\nr the effects of model uncertainty. Moreover, most f\norecasts are not, in fact, purely model-\nbased: a wealth of other information and expert opinions is included.  Therefore, the Bank of England, the EC\nB, the Bundesbank and most other in-\nstitutions™ estimates for forecasting \nuncertainty are based on forecast errors \ndiscovered ex post\n, that is ﬁwith the benefit of hindsightﬂ. For instance, the \nmean absolute error, the \nvariance or the standard deviation of the errors can \nbe used as a measure of forecasting uncertainty.  Nowadays, the Bank of England, for ex\nample, employs a variance measure. In accordance with ECB practice for \npublishing Eurosystem projections, the \nmeasure of uncertainty used by the Bundesbank is the mean absolute forecast error above and below the point projecti\non, which constitutes an uncertainty \nband. So, the width of the uncertai\nnty band is double the mean absolute fore-\ncast error. If the errors oc\ncur randomly and are normally\n distributed, this area \ncovers just under 60% of the distribution.  However, in contrast to the Bank of\n England, the ECB and the Bundesbank do \nnot relate forecast uncertainty to a certai\nn distribution. The Bank of England, \nrelying on its variance measure derived from past forecast errors, publishes a \ndensity forecast, thereby enabling the public to ca\nlculate any preferred meas-\nure of forecast uncertainty. \nThe forecast density also allows the calculation of \nprobabilities associated with certain inflat\nion ranges, that is, for example, the \nprobability that inflation will lie between 1% and 2% in a specific period.", "Embargo: 10 June 2008, 5.30 pm local time\n  Page 15 of 25 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nHowever, such a probability can, in pri\nnciple, also be determined using the \nforecasts of the ECB and the Bundesbank\n. The main difference from the fore-\ncasts of the Bank of England is that\n the ECB and the Bundesbank leave the \nassumption about the distribution of \nthe forecast errors to the public. 3.2 Risks associated with macroeconomic forecasts \nIt is often assumed that uncertainties \nare distributed symmetrically around the \ncentral forecast. However, \ndepending on the specific \ndata situation and condi-\ntions, there may well be signs when the projections are produced that this will \nnot be the case. Indeed, unlike in the historical patterns, there is not a sym-\nmetrical, but often a skewed distributi\non, which means that a deviation from \nthe central forecast to one side is\n more likely than to the other side. \nTechnically speaking, in such a case\n, the single most likely outcome Œ the \npoint forecast or mode Œ deviates fr\nom the expected average outcome Œ the \nmean forecast. If this is the case, the terms ﬁupsideﬂ or ﬁdownsideﬂ risks are \nused as part of a central bank™s risk analysis.  In this context, a distinction can \nbe made between exogenous risk factors Œ \nespecially developments in the world \neconomy and interest\n rates Œ and en-\ndogenous (domestic) risk factors. For example, unexpected movements in oil \nprices or exchange rates or \nfurther implications of \nthe financial market turbu-\nlence we have been observing during the \npast ten months are considered to \nbe risk factors at present.", "Embargo: 10 June 2008, 5.30 pm local time\n  Page 16 of 25 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nWhile the Bank of England quantifies \nthese risks and calculates its density \nforecasts accordingly, the ECB and t\nhe Bundesbank restric\nt themselves to \nqualitative risk assessments.

One pos-\nsible approach could be to communicate \nboth elements in a \npurely qualitative \n(verbal) way without any specific quantit\native piece of information. However, \nmany forecasting institutions apply a \nmethod which also includes some addi-\ntional numerical information or which, in\n addition, translates this information \ninto charts. The Bank of England, for instance, \nhas been publishing its well-known fan \ncharts for more than 12 years now. Thes\ne skewed fan charts reflect both the \ndegree of uncertainty and the perceived risk to the forecast and, being in the \nform of a graph, they are quite intuitive.

Rather, the Governing Council has decided to communi-\ncate the inherent uncertainty of forecast\ns by publishing the projections in the \nform of ranges, whose width is twice \nthe average value of the absolute fore-\ncast error. With respect to the issue of risk, some observers make the criticism that the \nEurosystem approach is not as advanced as\n that of the Bank of England, for \nexample, because how the projections \nare conveyed to the public does not \nadequately communicate the balance of ri\nsk to the projected outcome. In par-\nticular, the criticism has sometime\ns been made that the \nEurosystem does not make use of skewed fan charts as the Bank of England does. In this connection, I would like to st\nress that, although the Eurosystem does \nnot explicitly use fan charts, the way \nin which the Governing Council commu-\nnicates the balance of risks \nwith respect to the staff projection has, in my view, \nthe same information content, at least qualitatively. \nAt first sight, when looking at the ranges of the Eurosystem™s staff projections, \nthere seems to be no indication whether ri\nsks to the outlook are symmetrically \nor asymmetrically distributed Œ in other \nwords, whether ris\nks are balanced or skewed to the upside or downside. Therefo\nre, many observers simply take the \nmid-point of the projection ranges and int\nerpret this figure as the view of the \nGoverning Council. \nBut, in this context, there are two \nimportant elements Eurosystem observers \nshould not overlook. First, the projection \nexercise is carried\n out by staff mem-", "Embargo: 10 June 2008, 5.30 pm local time\n  Page 18 of 25 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nbers of the Eurosystem. Theref\nore, the projections do not necessarily reflect \nthe Governing Council™s view or its s\nubjective judgement. Second, and more \nimportantly, the ECB™s Governing Council does signal its subjective assess-\nment regarding the balance of risk to the st\naff projections by explicitly giving \nqualified indications in various ways. \nFor instance, at the most recent pr\ness conference following the Governing Council meeting last week, the ECB Pres\nident stressed, on behalf of the whole \nCouncil, that risks to the outlook for in\nflation remain on the upside in both the \nshort and medium term. He also indicated that the balance of risks to the out-\nput growth projections lie on the downside. Finally, he added that the uncer-\ntainty surrounding the outlook remain\ns high. Such messages are regularly \nconveyed not only in the press conference \nand the Monthly Bulletin, but also in \nmany speeches by members of the Governing Council. In my view, there is no fundamental \ndifference between publishing a skewed \nfan chart or indicating the asymmetry of ri\nsks in a qualitative,\n verbalised form \nlike the Eurosystem does. In other words, ﬁf\nans of the fan chartﬂ might see the \nGoverning Council™s statements on the Eurosystem staff projections as ﬁver-\n\nbalised fan chartsﬂ, reflecting the Go\nverning Council™s subjective judgements \nwith respect to the balance of risks. In our own Bundesbank approach, we hav\ne chosen to communicate uncer-\ntainty in the macroeconomic staff proje\nction for Germany in a more formal way \nthan the Eurosystem. This takes the form of an in-between view by adding a \nsymmetric fan chart to the central \nforecast regarding t\nhe economic develop-", "Embargo: 10 June 2008, 5.30 pm local time\n  Page 19 of 25 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nment in Germany. The main benefit of a fan \nchart is that it is pretty illustrative \nand, because of this, a fan chart is likely to convey more clearly the message \n\nand degree of uncertainty related to the projections. We arrived at a more sceptical assessm\nent regarding the associated question \nof whether such a fan chart should al\nso reflect a risk assessment, that is \nwhether Œ technically speaking Œ it shoul\nd also be skewed. To do this, the im-\npact of the various risk factors on the \nform and position of the density function \nof the forecast variable would have to be quantified.  \nAlthough different approaches exist, such as the one taken by the Bank of \nEngland, there is not yet any generally \naccepted procedure for achieving this. Furthermore, while the Bank of England™s \nrisk statements are, in quantitative \nterms, clearly more precise than the \nrisk statements of\n Bundesbank and the \nEurosystem, the basic question arises as\n to whether such precision is war-\nrantable. My answer is that I am rather \nsceptical about the \nability to forecast \nmacroeconomic risks in a precise, quantit\native manner. Therefore, it seems \npreferable to me to assess risks in\n a qualitative, verbal manner only. Put briefly, I think that our approach \nwith respect to the Bundesbank™s fore-\ncasts Œ symmetrically constructed un\ncertainty bands supplemented by a quali-\ntative (verbal) risk assessment Œ st\nrikes a good balance between displaying \nour view on the degree of uncertainty relat\ned to the forecast and, at the same \ntime, being aware of the limitations gener\nally faced by risk assessments.

Finally, let me briefly cover the role of pro-\njections in monetary poli\ncy and then draw a conclusion. \n 4 The role of projections in monetary policy \nThe role which macroeconomic projections \nplay in the conduct of actual mone-\ntary policy differs among central banks \naccording to the policy strategy they \npursue.  Macroeconomic projections and, in partic\nular, the inflation outlook, are the key \nelement of the monetary po\nlicy strategy referred to as ﬁinflation targetingﬂ or, \nmore precisely, ﬁinflation forecast target\ningﬂ. The Bank of England provides a \nclassical example of this policy approach.\n Pursuing such a strategy principally \nprovides a transparent decisi\non rule for monetary policy. In few words, the central bank sets its ke\ny interest rate in such a way as to en-\nsure that its own forecast coincides with the inflation target over the time hori-\n\nzon relevant to monetary policy. Hence, \nif the inflation proj\nection forecasts the \ninflation rate to be above the target, t\nhe decision rule suggests that key inter-\nest rates should be increased and vice v\nersa. Basically, owing to this rather \nsimple, but transparent and comprehensible rule, monetary policy becomes \nmore predictable, as the likely policy c\nourse of the central bank can be antici-\npated relatively well by market participants.", "Embargo: 10 June 2008, 5.30 pm local time\n  Page 21 of 25 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \nIt is well known that, in principle, a ru\nle-based and, thus, relatively predictable \nmonetary policy building on an explicit \npolicy strategy helps to reduce uncer-\ntainty and, thus, renders central bank policy more effective. \nHowever, central banks that\n act as inflation forecast\n targeters are not neces-\nsarily dependent on a new official inflation outlook in order to adjust their key \n\ninterest rate. The Bank of England, f\nor instance, has shown twice during the \npast two years that it is free to change its monetary policy stance without refer-\nring to a new inflation report. For many market participants, these int\nerest rate moves came as a surprise. \nThis underlines the point that forecast \ntargeting should not be misconstrued as \nan attempt at absolute monetary policy predict\nability, either in the timing or the \ndirection and size of policy moves. \nHence, in almost every case, central banks that pursue an inflation forecast \ntargeting strategy do so in a rather flexible way, thus leaving room for addi-\n\ntional policy manoeuvre if w\narranted by the specific situation. Notwithstanding \nits basically simple and intuitive decisi\non rule, inflation forecast targeting in-\ncludes a substantial degree of judgem\nent and should therefore not be con-\nfused with the notion of a mechanical reaction to the official inflation outlook. \nIn this context, one should also bear in\n mind that the Bank of England™s infla-\ntion outlook, for example, is not the out\ncome of a purely technical exercise. \nRather, it represents the iterative con\nduct of the forecasting exercise between \nthe Monetary Policy Committee and the ban\nk™s staff, and, ultimately, the sub-", "Embargo: 10 June 2008, 5.30 pm local time\n  Page 22 of 25 \n Deutsche Bundesbank Ł Communications Department Ł Wilhelm-E\npstein-Strasse 14 Ł 60431 Frankfurt am Main Ł Germany \nwww.bundesbank.de Ł E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank\n.de Ł Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 Ł Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction permitted only if source is stated \njective assessment of the Monetar\ny Policy Committee regarding medium-term \ninflationary pressures. Evidently, th\nis assessment can change between two \npublicly released inflation reports if si\ngnificant new information becomes avail-\nable. While the inflation outlook is of crucial \nimportance for inflation forecast target-\ning central banks, the Eurosystem ta\nkes a different approach. As outlined \nabove, we base our interest rate decisions\n on two pillars and\n do not target the \ninflation projection in a way a forecast-t\nargeting central bank does. This is par-\nticularly the case as the inflation projection reflects the assessment of the staff, not necessarily that of the Governing Council. \nOur two-pillar approach is designed to ens\nure that no relevant information is \nlost in the assessment of the risks to \nprice stability and that appropriate atten-\ntion is paid to different perspectives and \nthe cross-checking of information in \norder to come to an overall judgement of the risks to price stability. Against the backdrop of an \nenvironment generally cha\nracterised by consider-\nable uncertainty, the Eurosystem™s m\nonetary policy strategy allows the adop-\ntion of a robust monetary policy which redu\nces the risk of policy errors that \nmight be caused by over-reliance on a \nsingle indicator, forecast or model. \nIn this context, the regular broad ma\ncroeconomic projections are one impor-\ntant input factor for our policy decisions\n, but they are not the only relevant in-\nformation we make use of.

Inflation should be low and stable,\n and a central bank™s policy should \nfocus primarily on achieving this goal. \nThe actual monetary policy strategies, \nor, in other words, the way in which \ncentral banks try to live up to this goal, \nin fact differ to a \ncertain extent, as I \noutlined earlier when referring to the E\nurosystem™s and the Bank of England™s \napproach. However, irrespective of the differe\nnces between the respective strategies, \nthese variations should not be overstated \neither. Ultimately, I think that the ap-\nproaches adopted do not differ dramatically\n. This applies to the method and \nthe outcome, too. Evidently, either st\nability-oriented approac\nh proves to be \nlargely successful in containing both in\nflation and inflation expectations. \nAgainst this background, I do not see any\n signs that one approach might be \nclearly superior to the other, as some commentators suggest from time to \ntime. More precisely, I do not see any obvious shortcomings in our own ap-\n\nproach either.

As this is so, dif-\nferent policy frameworks for achieving t\nhe same ultimate goal Œ price stability \nŒ are an absolutely natural outco\nme, not a surprising one.
