Its title \n ﬁFrom academic to \npolicymakerﬂ  referred to the fact that I started out as an academic.\n1 I began that speech by \nmentioning a number of\n other academics who went on to \nbecome central bankers: Mervyn \nKing, Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen, Bill Pool\ne and Otmar Issing, to name but a few.  I continued by analysing why \nthere are so many academi\ncs in monetary policy. James \nBullard, by the way, is another \ncase in point, whom I did not mention at the time because he \nwas not yet in his current position. One of \nthe main reasons why, \nover the past years, \nacademic researchers have been \ntaking up leading positions at central banks is that \nmonetary policy itself has been heavily influenced\n by the findings of academic research. \nDuring the financial crisis, monetary policy and economies across the world have benefited \nsignificantly from these insights, since they \nhave helped us to swiftly apply the appropriate \npolicy responses to contain the crisis. Conver\nsely, the crisis has also raised important \nissues for academic research, in monetary economics as well as in other fields. As of next month, after seven \nyears as a policymaker, I shall be \ntaking up the position of a \nfaculty member of the Universi\nty of Chicago Boot\nh School. In spite of this upcoming \ntransition ﬁfrom policymaker to academicﬂ, my \nremarks today on the challenges for monetary \npolicy in EMU will be given from the policymaker™s perspective.                                            \n 1 See A A Weber (2007), From Academic to Polic\ny Maker, CEPR-CEPREMAP Lec\ntures on Policy Making, \nParis, 29 May 2007.", ")  Page 4 of 16 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \n2 The financial crisis and its lessons for monetary policy \nThe crisis has brought the ﬁm\nonetary policy consensusﬂ formed \nin the years prior to the \ncrisis under scrutiny.\n2 The framework of monetary policy \ndiffered significantly from one \ncentral bank to another. Nevertheless, across \nthe board their primary objective was price \nstability Œ defined as a stabilisat\nion of the inflation rate at\n around 2% across a horizon of \napproximately two years. Steeri\nng short-term interest rates \nwas considered a sufficient \nmeans of achieving this target. Central bank \nforecasts played a key role in monetary policy \ndecision-making, with monetary aggr\negates increasingly taking a back seat in many forecast \nmodels.  Furthermore, capital markets were mostly a\nssumed to be efficient, \nmeaning that financial \nimperfections and their potent\nial macroeconomic effects were not taken into account. \nTemporary inefficiencies, such as asset pric\ne bubbles, were considered possible, but the \nmajority view was that monetary policy coul\nd do little to counteract such developments. \nMicroprudential supervision was regarded as a suffi\ncient means of containing risks in the \nfinancial sector. Monetary policymakers should \nintervene only after a financial crisis had \noccurred, minimising the macroeconomic damage through resolute interest rate cuts. Even though monetary policy proved indispensable and highly su\nccessful in containing the \ncrisis and in preventing a melt\ndown of the financial system, \nevents have cast doubt on this \nconsensus. The question now is whether, and to \nwhat extent, monetary policy should take \naccount of financial market devel\nopments before a crisis occurs.\n3 Let me elaborate on some \naspects of this in greater depth.                                            \n 2 See C Bean, M Paustian, A Penalver and T Taylor (2010\n), Monetary Policy after the Fall, Jackson Hole 2010 \nSymposium Proceedings, Federal Re\nserve Bank of Kansas City. \n3 See also Deutsche Bundesbank (2011), The implications \nof the financial crisis for monetary policy, Monthly \nBulletin, March 2011, pp. 53-68.", ")  Page 5 of 16 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \n2.1 A stronger role for financial ma\nrkets in monetary policy analysis– \nGiven the genesis of the crisis, \nit is undeniable that monetary policy with too short a policy \nhorizon can fail to take account of financial imbal\nances that eventually spill over to the real \neconomy, thus jeopardising price stability. So\n, how should monetary policy incorporate the \nexperience of the crisis into its decision-making process? In the pre-crisis phase, monet\nary policy decisions were often \nbased on models in which the \nfinancial sector played only a mi\nnor or no role at all. Ther\nefore, an obvious and important \nlesson from the crisis is that\n the theoretical and empirical \nfoundations of monetary policy \nmust place a greater emphasis on both the banking sector and financial imperfections. \nAs regards the Eurosystem™s m\nonetary policy strategy, the monetary pillar already contains \nmajor elements of such an approach. In the \nmore recent past, the Eurosystem has stepped \nup its efforts to continually\n enhance its monetary analysis.\n4 The aim is to identify \nirregularities in the patterns \nof a number of variables, sinc\ne an unusual pattern in loan \ndevelopments and monetary aggregates can provide valuable indications of excessive credit \ngrowth. This requires, among other things, \nan extension of the usual decision-making \nhorizon, as financial distortions o\nften build up over a fairly long\n period of time. As a result, \nmonetary policy should become more symmetric\nal over the financial cycle and can thus \nmake a key contribution to financial stability.5                                            \n 4 See L Papademos and J Stark (eds), Enhancing monetary analysis, ECB, Frankfurt am Main, 2010. \n5 See A A Weber (2010), Comment on Jordi Galí Œ \nThe Monetary Pillar and the Great Financial Crisis, \ncolloquium held in honour of Lucas Papademos, 21 Mai 2010, Frankfurt am Main.", ")  Page 6 of 16 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \n2.2 – but a separate toolkit is \nneeded for financial stability – \nHowever, this alone is insufficient to ensure fi\nnancial stability. Until the crisis, the majority \nview had been that asset price \nbubbles are difficult to identify \nin a timely manner and that \ninterest rates are too blunt a tool to burst such bubbles at an \nearly stage. These reservations \nhave not been invalidated by the cr\nisis and, therefore,\n the debate on how to better prevent \nfinancial crises turned to the spec\nific incentives within the fi\nnancial system a\nnd the existing \nsupervision, which focuses primarily on i\nndividual institutions, as these may have \nencouraged the build-up of debt\n-financed imbalances. Thus, a greater emphasis should be \nplaced on macroprudential \nanalysis and regulation.\n6 The aim of macroprudential policy is to \ncontain systemic risk, thus strengthening the re\nsilience of the financial system as a whole. \nThis is designed to ensure th\nat externalities within t\nhe financial system, notably the \nprocyclicality and interconnectedness of fi\nnancial institutions, can be addressed \nappropriately.7 Consequently, existing supervisory t\nools must be expande\nd or adjusted so \nas to prevent systemic risk from arising in futu\nre and to considerably \nreduce the likelihood of \ncredit and asset price bubbles.  2.3 – and price stability remains the primary objective of monetary policy \nAgainst this background, monetary policy and its tools must remain focused on price stability \nand should not be overbur\ndened with other objectives. In fa\nct, the credibility of monetary \npolicy depends not only on \nthe clarity of its objectives but \nalso on transparency regarding its \n                                           \n 6 See Deutsche Bundesbank, Approaches to the meas\nurement and macroprudential treatment of systemic \nrisk, Monthly Report, March 2011, pp. 37-52; Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, BASEL III: A global \nregulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems, December 2010. \n7 A range of tools aimed at curtailing both procyclicalit\ny and network risk is currently under discussion.

Adopting financ\nial stability as an additional\n, independent monetary policy \nobjective runs the risk of ar\nousing unrealistic expectations \nabout the effectiveness of \nmonetary policy tools. Neverthel\ness, central banks as institut\nions may still be given the \nadditional task of pursuing financia\nl stability, as long as\n they also have the appropriate set of \nadditional independent tools available to them. Indeed, central banks™ expertise constitutes a forceful argument for them continuing to play\n a prominent role in analysing and assessing \nfinancial stability. The advantage \nof having independent tools for pr\nice stability and financial stability is evident when there is a need for \nmonetary and macroprudential policies to be \nadjusted in different ways. Ne\nvertheless, as developments in\n money and financial markets \nare of key importance for bot\nh monetary policy and macroprudential policy, there are likely \ninterdependencies between them t\nhat should be taken into account. For example, banks™ \nlending is not only impor\ntant for the monetary transmission \nprocess but is also a link for \nmacroprudential policy. This open\ns up the opportunity for policy \ndecisions in both spheres to \ncomplement each another, but it\n also harbours the danger of \nthem counteracting each other \nor even cancelling each other out.  There is no single answer to the question of \nhow necessary or advantageous a coordination \nof policy areas would be.\n8 Recent research has provided so\nme initial clues and corroborates \nthe view that the inflation ra\nte can be stabilised quite well \nif macroprudential \npolicy has its own tools and works alongside monetary policy.9                                             \n 8 See Committee on the Global Financial System (201\n0), Macroprudential instruments and frameworks: a \nstocktaking of issues and experiences, CGFS Paper 38. \n9 See, for example, D Beau, L Clerc and B Mojon \n(2011), Macro-Prudential Policy and the Conduct of \nMonetary Policy, Banque de France, mimeo; I Chri\nstensen, C Meh and K Moran (2010), Bank Leverage \nRegulation and Macroeconomic Dynamics, Bank of Canada, mimeo.", ")  Page 8 of 16 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nHowever, harmful effects with respect to infl\nation rate volatility can arise if monetary \npolicymakers ignore the impact of macropr\nudential tools on the financial markets.10 If central \nbanks take decisions regarding \nboth macroprudential and monetary policy tools, additional \nfluctuations in the inflation ra\nte compared with the monetary policy \nstatus quo\n can be \nvirtually ruled out, and such fluctuations could even be reduced overall.\n11 These preliminary results should be interpreted with caution. First, the underlying dynamic \nstochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model\ns only approximately reproduce the complex interactions between the real and the financial se\nctors. Second, such re\nsearch is only in its \ninfancy; at present, only a few models allo\nw a simultaneous analysis of monetary and \nmacroprudential policy.\n12 Nevertheless, the results confi\nrm that there should be a clear \nallocation of objectives and tools \nin order to achieve the aims of\n both policies. Assuming that there will be a satisfactory exchange of\n information between both monetary and \nmacroprudential policymakers in the future, the exis\nting studies give no cause to fear that \nthe objective of price stability will have to be compromised.  2.4 Price stability should still be unde\nrstood to mean low inflation rates \nEven though the pre-crisis consensus regarding \nprice stability as the \nprimary objective of \nmonetary policy remains valid, it can be asked \nwhether experience of t\nhe crisis should have \nimplications for the specific form that the objecti\nve of price stability take\ns.

Two \ncompeting approaches have been suggested to deal \nwith this alleged shortcoming: A higher \ninflation target,13 and a switch to targeting the price leve\nl or, more precisely, the price-level \npath.14 Neither of the two alte\nrnatives convinces me. \nAs regards a higher inflation target, it is not\n only the substantial a\nnd ongoing welfare losses \naccompanying a rise in the inflation target \nthat argue against this proposal but also, above \nall, the loss of credibility fo\nr monetary policy asso\nciated with such a discretionary measure.\n15 The resulting destabilisation of inflation expectations w\nould make it significantly more \ndifficult for the central bank to achieve its (po\nssibly higher) inflation target and to safeguard \nmacroeconomic stability. Compared with a strategy of infl\nation targeting, price-level ta\nrgeting does display a number \nof advantages, at least in theory. It opens up the \noption of influencing private sector inflation \nexpectations and thus of combati\nng deflationary risks in the event \nof a crisis. However, it is \ndoubtful whether a change in the tar\nget specification in the event \nof acute deflationary risk \nwould be suitable for achieving the desired pos\nitive effect on private sector inflation \nexpectations.16 A more serious problem is that a st\nrategy of price-level targeting is \n                                           \n 13 See J C Williams (2009), Heeding Deadalus: Optimal Inflation and the Zero Lower Bound, Brookings Papers \non Economic Activity 2, pp 1-37; O J Blanchard\n, G Dell™Ariccia and P Mauro (2010), Rethinking \nMacroeconomic Policy, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking 42, pp 199-215. \n14 Eggertsson and Woodford already proposed price-leve\nl targeting in connection with the deflation \nexperienced in Japan; see G B Eggertsson and M Woodf\nord (2003), The zero bound on interest rates and \noptimal monetary policy, Brookings Pape\nrs on Economic Activity 1, pp 139-211. \n15 See A A Weber (2010), Der IWF spielt mit dem Feuer \n(The IMF is playing with fire), Financial Times \nDeutschland, 25 February, 2010 (available in German only). \n16 See C Walsh (2010), The future of inflation target\ning, University of Califor\nnia, Santa Cruz, mimeo.", ")  Page 10 of 16 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nassociated with a few additional drawbacks com\npared with optimal monetary policy, casting \ndoubt on whether such a change of strategy would be beneficial.17 All in all, this means that nei\nther raising the infl\nation target nor swit\nching to price-level \ntargeting would be appropriate \nfrom an economic stability poin\nt of view. Instead, this \nproblem must be tackled at r\noot; the existing wrong incentiv\nes and regulatory loopholes \nmust be eliminated in order to \nmake crises less likely and less severe. It is, in any case, \nquestionable whether the \nleeway available to monetary pol\nicy at the lower bound of the \nnominal short-term money market rates actually\n was that limited. Cent\nral banks™ experience \nof the effectiveness of unconventi\nonal measures during the crisis give no cause for viewing \nthe lower bound of the interest rate as a bindi\nng restriction on the effectiveness of monetary \npolicy. \n3 Particular lessons for mon\netary policy in th\ne euro area All the issues I have been talkin\ng about up to now concern more or less all central banks \nand every monetary policymaker. For the remainder of my speech,\n I would like to focus on \nthe particular challenges for monetary poli\ncy in the euro area. These arise from the \nsovereign debt crisis, which is \nthe major challenge for economic\n and monetary union. The \ncircumstances surrounding the debt crisis ar\ne aggravating the conduct of the Eurosystem™s \ncommon monetary policy, which \nis geared towards maintaining \nprice stability in the euro \narea as a whole.                                            \n 17 See Deutsche Bundesbank, Price-level targeting as \na monetary policy strategy, Monthly Report, January \n2010, pp 31-45; C Gerberding, R Gerke and F Hammerma\nnn (2010), Price-level targeting when there is \nprice-level drift, Deutsche Bundesb\nank Research Centre, Discussion \npaper, Series 1, No 23/2010.", ")  Page 11 of 16 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \n3.1 Heterogeneity as a challenge for monetary policy \nOne of the aggravating factors is heterogene\nity in terms of growth, inflation and \ncompetitiveness. With regard \nto the euro-area countries™ ec\nonomic performance, we are \ncurrently observing a widening di\nvergence. Broadly speaking, ther\ne is a considerable growth \ngap between the core and the periphery, or to put\n it more precisely, some peripheral \ncountries of the euro area.  In my view, the economic heterogeneity of t\nhe euro area is a non-issue. Why should \nheterogeneity be a problem for the single monetary policy? After all, the dispersion of growth \nrates, as measured by the wei\nghted standard deviation\ns of quarterly growth rates, is not \nsignificantly greater than in the first years of EM\nU. With regard to inflation variance, we see \neven lower values than then. Furthermore, \nthe US economy is characterised by \nconsiderable heterogeneity, too,\n and that does not impede the \nFederal Reserve™s monetary \npolicy, either. And in much the same was as \nthe FOMC is focused on the US as a whole, \nthe Governing Council of the \nECB has to take a euro-area-wi\nde perspective: While national \ndevelopments have to be taken into considerati\non, monetary policy cannot be tailored to the \nspecific needs of individual member states.  \nThe real problem with heterogenei\nty, and that is a concern to me, is that a number of \ncountries have obviously failed\n to meet the obligations and requirements of a currency \nunion. The persistent pr\noblems of countries in refinancing \ntheir debt are \nonly the symptoms of the problems, not the probl\nem itself. The financial crisis\n has revealed unsustainable \ndevelopments in some member countries Œ dev\nelopments which were already in existence \nbefore the crisis: too much publ\nic spending, unproductive use of \ncapital inflows, losses of \ncompetitiveness. Those were just some of \nthe shortcomings whic\nh had been carelessly \nneglected, not least by the fi\nnancial markets. Painful adjus\ntment processes, including", ")  Page 12 of 16 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nstructural reform and budget cons\nolidation, are essential to\n restore the ability of the \ncountries concerned to live up to the demands of the single monetary policy.  \n3.2 Fiscal stabilisation measu\nres were necessary but they undermined the basic \nfounding principles of EMU Ensuring financial stability in the euro area \nrequired and justified fiscal aid for Greece and the establishment of a tempor\nary stabilisation mechanism. Nevertheless, these particular \nmeasures have undermined the \nfoundations of EMU.  \nThe establishment of EMU was \nbased on principles that were \ndeemed necessary in order to \nmake the euro a stable currency. According to\n the principle of subsidiarity, economic \npolicies other than monetary policy remain the re\nsponsibility of national\n governments. With \nregard to fiscal policy, rules \nand institutional a\nrrangements were established to ensure \nsound fiscal policies in the me\nmber states. Furthermore, a ﬁ\nno bail-outﬂ clause stipulated \nnational responsibility of each country for repaying its own public debt. Rules for sound public finances are of particula\nr importance in a monetary union since the \nincentives for excessive borrowing are even gr\neater in a monetary union than they are \nanyway. Excessive borrowing can also place a \nstrain on the conduct of\n a stability-oriented \nmonetary policy. Unsound public finances are t\nhe Achilles heel of a monetary union of \nindependent states. Purchases of government bonds \nfor monetary policy purposes, fo\nr example, harbour the risk \nof blurring the boundaries between monetary\n and fiscal policy, particularly given high \ngovernment deficits and debt levels. This might harm the \ncredibility of monetary policy.

This principle applies not only with respect to \nfinancial stability, but also fiscal policy. \nDuring the financial crisis, the Eurosystem Œ like the central banks of other major economic \nregions Œ took unconventiona\nl monetary policy measures \non an unprecedented scale. The \nample provision of liquidity was effective in\n offsetting the consequences of the abrupt \ndecline in market liquidity, in maintaining m\nonetary policy transmission, and, ultimately, in \nhelping to prevent the real ec\nonomy from sliding into a pr\nolonged depression. On the other \nhand, unlimited provision of central bank liqui\ndity to banks without a sustainable business \nmodel cannot be a long-run soluti\non. Again, monetary policy shou\nld not act as a substitute \nfor tasks of other policy areas. In particula\nr, monetary policy should not and cannot \npersistently replace the repair of banks™ ba\nlance sheets. The phasi\nng-out of non-standard \nmeasures has to be continued; the objective is\n to return to the pre-crisis operational \nframework which has proven \nits effectiveness and flexibility during the crisis. 3.3 Economic governance in the euro area needs reform \nSince the fiscal stabilisation measures in favour of euro-area peripheral countries have \nundermined the basic principles \nof EMU, it is obvious that\n there has to be a fundamental \nand far reaching reform of economic governanc\ne in the euro area. The European leaders \nagreed that the fiscal rules have to be tightened \nsince their application in practice had \nproven to be too weak. They agreed, secondly,\n that macroeconomic im\nbalances should be \naddressed earlier and more effectively.\n The crisis demonstrated \nthat sound public finances \nare a necessary, but not sufficient condition fo\nr financial and economic stability.

In March, the leaders agreed on what they \nview as a comprehensive package. The \nmeasures it contains certainl\ny represent a step in the right \ndirection, but they are not a \nﬁquantum leap towards strengthening th\ne institutional framework of EMUﬂ\n18 which is \nrequired to reinforce economic governance in t\nhe euro area. Ultimately, the future success \nof EMU will hinge crucially on the member st\nates™ willingness to comply\n with the tighter set \nof rules. 4 Conclusion Tomorrow, it will be 17 years ago to the \nday since Helmut Schlesinger, one of my \npredecessors as President of the Bundesbank\n held the Eighth Ho\nmer Jones Memorial \nLecture. In his speech on ﬁOn the Way to a \nNew Monetary Unionﬂ he\n explained to the \naudience in St. Louis the historic disput\ne between ﬁmonetaristsﬂ and ﬁeconomistsﬂ.\n19 In the \nparticular context of European monetary integr\nation, these terms had a totally different \nmeaning to our general underst\nanding. ﬁMonetaristsﬂ, he explain\ned, ﬁbelieved that monetary \nintegration has to start first and that econom\nic and political int\negration would follow.ﬂ ﬁEconomistsﬂ, however, ﬁbelieved that ec\nonomic convergence between the national \neconomies must occur before – a monetary union.ﬂ                                            \n 18 European Central Bank (2010), Reinforc\ning economic governance in the euro area, \nhttp://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/reinforcingecono\nmicgovernanceintheeuroareaen.pdf, p. 4. \n19 See H Schlesinger (1994), On the Way to a New Monetary Union: The European Monetary Union, The \nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, Vol. 76, No. 3, May June, pp. 3-10.", ")  Page 15 of 16 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nThe ﬁmonetaristsﬂ prevailed, but t\nhey erred in their belief that \nthe introduction of the single \ncurrency would automatically act as a locomotive\n for the political union\n of Europe. There is \nno political union so far and there is little expecta\ntion that this might change significantly in \nthe foreseeable future. Therefore, national ex\necutive and legislative \nbranches will remain \nresponsible for economic \nand fiscal policies over th\ne medium to long term. \nIntergovernmental fiscal transfers beyond t\nhe rather moderate and earmarked payments \nfrom the EU budget (approximat\nely 1% of GNP) are hardly ac\nceptable; overburdening the \nfinancial solidarity of the people might jeopardise the idea\n of European integration. The ﬁeconomistsﬂ, on the other hand, had \na point in demanding more economic \nconvergence. Their worries were, by the way, ta\nken into account by the implementation of \nconvergence criteria t\nhat have to be fulfilled before a c\nountry can join the euro area. The \nunderlying problem of the cu\nrrent crisis is, however, \nnot a lack of convergence \nex ante\n or \nheterogeneity per se\n; rather it is the la\nck of willingness on the part \nof a number of member \nstates to meet the requirement\ns of the membership in a monetary union. If they fail to \ncorrect these deficiencies swiftly and thoroughly,\n stability oriented mo\nnetary policy in EMU \nwill become increasingly difficult, all the mo\nre so as monetary policy has been profoundly \nchallenged by the financial crisis.  \nThe major lessons that central bankers in the \neuro area and elsewhere \nshould take to heart \nare the following: Firstly, m\nonetary policy has to consider th\ne implications of financial \ninstability for price stability; monetary and credit aggregates can provide helpful information \nin this regard. Secondly, since the policy rate\n remains too blunt a t\nool to tackle financial \nimbalances, the objective of financial stability r\nequires its own, macroprudential set of tools, \nwhereas maintaining price stabi\nlity should remain the primary \nobjective of monetary policy. \nThirdly, price stability should continue to \nbe seen as a stable and low inflation rate.", ")  Page 16 of 16 \n Deutsche Bundesbank \n Communications Department \n Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14 \n 60431 Frankfurt am Main \n Germany www.bundesbank.de \n E-mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de \n Tel: +49 69 9566 3511/3512 \n Fax: +49 69 9566 3077 \nReproduction is permitted only if source is stated. \nFinally, without stability orient\ned prudent fiscal policy \nmonetary policy will find it increasingly \ndifficult to ensure price stability at low interest rates.
