BUNDESBANK Embargo: February 3, 2004, 06:00p.m. CET Ladies and gentlernen Thank you very much for your warm welcome. I am glad to be here with you tonight. I very much appreciate the opportunity to speak to, and discuss matters with, such a distinguished audience from the business sector. My remarks today are grouped into three sections. I would like to start with some comments on the economic recovery in Germany and in Europe. To widen the perspective, I shall then outline a number of major shifts in the composition of global growth and world trade flows. Finally, I shall give you my view on structural reforms for a more dynamic economy in order to meet the demographic and competitive challenges that lie ahead. First of all, however, I would like to tell you that the Executive Board of the Bundesbank has de~cided to advocate a renewal of the Gold Agreementafter the current agreement expires in autumn. The terms and conditions should be similar to those of the current agreement. Sales of araund 2,000 tonnes of central banks' gold over a period of five years would translate into annual sales of about 400 tonnes. The Bundesbank envisages a quota of about 120 tonnes a year, which is equivalent to 4% of the total stock.

Hence, it is appropriate to manage this asset in a manner which safeguards its underlying value. Future generations should also be able to derive banefit from this asset. I will soon be taking up talks with the Federal Government and the parliamentary par-ties on the specifics of how to manage this asset. 1 Developing economic recovery A whole series of indicators is pointing to an ongoing recovery in the world economy. After hitting a trough last March, stock markets which show some ieading indicator properties - have accompiished a powerful turnaround. Businesssentiment indicators started to change for the better in summer. For some weeks now, releases of economic data have been providing confirmation that economic activity is picking up. I am confident that autumn saw a change for the better. 1.1 Europe and Germany ln the wake of accelerating growth in the USA and in Asia, world trade is returning to considerably higher growth rates. External demand has been the main factor behind the initial signs of improving economic activity in the euro area. ln the third quarter- the most recent quarter for which detailed data are available - external dE~mand was the only component to make a Seite 3 von 1 5 Deutsche Bundesbank • Zentrale • Presse und Information • Wilhelm-Epstein-Straße 14 • 60431 Frankfurt am Main www.bundesbank.de • E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de • Tel.: 069 9566-3511 • Fax: 069 9566-3077 Bei publizistischer Verwertun!g wird um die Angabe der Quelle gebeten.Deutsche Bundesbank, 03.02.2004 _.IDEUTSCHE ~. .

Consumption essentially stagnated, while stock-building and investment made a negative contribution. The componE~nts added up to a 0.4% growth in GDP on the quarter. Leading indicators point to a strengthening of economic activity during the final quarter of 2003. New industrial orders have come in stronger since the beginning of the final quarter. At the same time, there has been an increase in capacity utilisation - October 2002. for the first time since Nationai data from Germany have bolstered the latest euro-area indicators. ln Germany, ne~w orders and industrial output have been on a remarkable uptrend. The lfo business climate index showed a ninth successive increase in January. High-flying business ex pectations are now being IUnderpinned by an improved assessment of the current business situation. The Bundesbank's estimate of fourth quarter GDP growth is +0.25%. However, the initial estimate of German GDP in 2003 is only -0.1% growth on the year. All in all, most recent data are encouraging, although they do not yet make foravigoraus economic expansion. For the export-driven recovery to Iead to a self-sustaining expansion, domestic demand would need to pick up- both consumption and investment.

A weak job market and the need for pension provisioning are weighing on private consumption. On the other hand, there seems tobe a considerable amount of pent-up demand. German cars that are currently on the road, for example, are fairly old on average. Stable prices underpinned by the euro ex change rate are bolstering incomes in real terms. ln an environment of favourable financial conditions- which have prevailed for quite some time now - firmer expectations of increasing sales should spark investment demand even though capacity utilisation is far below its maximum Ievei.

Businesses' expert expect:ations remain generally upbeat despite some concern about a potentiallass of price competitiveness following a marked rise in the external value of the euro. Certainly, any currency appreciation tends to imply a lass of price competitiveness unless it is offset by an increase in productivity or by cost-cutting. lt is important not to overestimate the effect the euro appreciation has on overallexpert demand and, even more so, on the economic recovery. The impact of world trade and world growth dynamics far outweighs the influence of the exchange rate. A streng currency is an asset. The streng Deutschmark served Germany weil.

The US twin deficits are a concern in this respect. ln the late 1990s, the US current account deficit had its domestic counterpart in high investment spending. lt was financed by foreign private investors seeking an opportunity to invest in the US cerparate sector. Today's current account deficit has a domestic flip side in terms of a high budget deficit. lt is financed to a large extent by Asian central banks which purchase US treasuries by intervening in the foreign e~xchange markets. Exchange rate movements like the dollar depreciation help to unwind imbalances in the world economy, even though they cannot do the trick entirely on their own. The domestic causes of those imbalances need tobe addressed. For Europe, the main task in this respect is to boost growth potential by embarking on structural reforms in order to ease existing economic ri~~idities. The monetary policy strate~gy of the euro area does not target the exchange rate. The external value of the euro is one of many factors shaping the prospects for price stability. The ECB Governing Council closely monitors developrnents in the euro's exchange rate. Cur rently, the streng euro allows us to keep interest rates at a low Ievei in an environment where demand is picking up and excess liquidity persists.

Any perception that reforming zeal is weakening might therefore do harm to the recovering economy. Moreover, reforms are crucial for enhancing competitiveness. 2 Trends in the world economy I would like to widen my ptarspective at this point and discuss some rather global topics. Globalisation, deregulation and market orientation have helped to change the shape of the world economy significantiy over the past few decades. Vve have witnessed the integration of more and more countries into the world markets and a sharp rise in global trade. During the past 30 years, the cross-border exchange of goods and services increased ninefold (in terms of volume) to more than US$ 7,000 billion in 2003. At the same time, substantial changes in the regional composition of trade flows have occurred. While the industrial countries' real share in world exports has gone down from 70% to 60%, that of developing countries has gained ground. The fast-growing economies in East Asia, in par-ticular, have been extremely successful in integrating into the world economy. Their market share of world exports went up from 6% in the 1970s to about one-fifth in 2003. By no later than 2010, East Asia, including Japan, might account for more than one-third of world trade and thus become Seite 7 von 15 Deutsche Bundesbank • Zentrale • Presse und Information • Wilhelm-Epstein-Straße 14 • 60431 Frankfurt am Main www.bundesbank.de • E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de • Tel.: 069 9566-3511 • Fax: 069 9566-3077 Bei publizistischer Verwertun!~ wird um die Angabe der Quelle gebeten.Deutsche Bundesbank, 03.02.2004 ··JDEUTSC HE ~. BUNDESBANK Embargo: February 3, 2004, 06:00p.m. CET the world's most important trading area, ahead of the European Union. The export-oriented development strategy of the Asian economies - in centrast to the more inward-looking approach in Latin America - has brought a considerable measure of success. lt has stimulated not only cross-border trade but also economic growth. Developing Asian economies currently account for nearly one-quarter of global production. They have exploited their capacity for fast growth by • efficiently mobilising thHir physical and human resources • adapting foreign technology and • utilising the opportunities for specialisation resulting from their integration into the world economy. As a consequence, they have roughly doubled their economic weight over the past 30 years. Re~al convergence - as suggested by growth theory- seems to work if the right conditions are in place. At the same time, advanced economies, most notably west and east European countries, have lost significant market shares in world production. Slow population growth, modest gains in productivity and the breakdown of the former Communist planned economies have hampered their economic performance. At present, advanced Seite 8 von 15 Deutsche Bundesbank • Zentrale • Presse und Information • Wilhelm-Epstein-Straße 14 • 60431 Frankfurt am Main www.bundesbank.de • E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de • Tel.: 069 9566-3511 • Fax: 069 9566-3077 Bei publizistischer Verwertun1~ wird um die Angabe der Quelle gebeten.Deutsche Bundesbank, 03.02.2004 ··IDEUTSC HE ~. BUNDESBANK Embargo: February 3, 2004, 06:00p.m. CET economies, while representing no more than about one-sixth of world population, account for 55% of global gross domestic product (GDP) based on purchasing power parity (PPP) valuation - about 5 percentage points less than in 1980. The transition countries' share of global GDP has gonedown from 12%% to 6%%, although there has been a small increase recently. For the sake of completeness, Iet me say that the United States' share of global GDP has not changed much over this period. However, in recent years China has been the most outstanding example in terms of eco-nomic performance. Over the past ten years the Chinese economy has grown on average by more than 8% annually in real terms - faster than other Asian countries and very much more than the advanced economies (2%%). Admittedly, China is still a relatively poor country, but the pace at which it is catching up is remarkable. Measured in terms of purchasing power parities, China currently accounts for about 12%% of world production and 5% of world trade. Bearing these shifts in mind, one is inclined to ask how the world economy might Iook in 10 years or so. Same experts forecast that the Asian economies (excluding Japan), and especially China, will grow rapidly over this period. As a consequence, they see China and the United States having roughly equallevels of GDP in 2015 (assuming PPP valuation).

Same risks are evident in the case of, say, the necessary transformation of loss making state enterprises and urgent reforms in the financial sector in China - to mention just two economic factors. With respect to the United States, we have recently observed relatively high productivity growth rates, which might contribute to higher-than-expected GDP Ieveis in the US, but the risks arising from the twin deficits in the medium term should not be underrated. lrrespective of the question of which economy will beinpole position in 2015, unwinding global imbalances and strengthening economic grow1h pose difficult challemges for the international community. 3 Economic and social reforms About a year ago, Germany was undergoing a deep crisis of confidence. At the time, only staunch optimists would have thought possible what is now law in Germany. We are being serious about economic reform. Under the heading of \"Agenda 201 0\", the state as we know it is being transformed. A new balance is tobestruck between the public and the private sector. This process may weil be described as a paradigm shift. The old ideal of providing social justice through a highly redistributive state is fading away. The ideal has simply failed to live up to expectations. The role of the state is now being re-defined as a more Seite 10 von 15 Deutsche Bundesbank • Zentrale • Presse und Information • Wilhelm-Epstein-Straße 14 • 60431 Frankfurt am Main www.bundesbank.de • E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de • Tel.: 069 9566-3511 • Fax: 069 9566-3077 Bei publizistischer Verwertung wird um die Angabe der Quelle gebeten.Deutsche Bundesbank, 03.02.2004 ··IDEUTSC HE ... BUNDESBANK Embargo: February 3, 2004, 06:00p.m. CET subsidiary one. The other side of the equation is that people are being increasingly allowed - and, indeed, expected - to manage their own affairs. Efficient markets and a proper set of incentives are reinforcing this trend. ln short, members of the public are being called upon to take responsibility for themselves and to make their own decisions. Only those who are unable to do that can count on the state for support. Fora large part of Europe, this approach amounts to a minor revolution. 3.1 Reforms accomplished Eariy iast year, the Bundesbank published a paper entitled \"vVays Oüt of the crisis\". The paper proposed applying a coherent overall strategy for structural reforms in the labour market, the social security systems and fiscal policy. Despite some shortcomings, a major portion of the reforms now being implemented are in line with our proposals. I would like to stress the enhanced flexibility of the labour market that has now been accomplished. Fixed-term contracts can be used more extensively when setting up a new business. Dismissal-protection rules have been eased for small businesses, thus lowering a major hurdle to new recruitment. lncentives to work in the low-wage sector have been increased by reducing the period of entitlement to transfer payments from 18 to 12 months in most cases. Furthermore, the Deutsche Bundesbank • Zentrale • Presse und Information • Wilhelm-Epstein-Straße 14 • 60431 Frankfurt am Main www.bundesbank.de • E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de • Tel.: 069 9566-3511 • Fax: 069 9566-3077 Bei publizistischer Verwertung wird um die Angabe der Quelle gebeten.

Germany has begun to cut back subsidies such as tax breaks for commuters or new home-owners. ln the statutory health insurance system, patients now share the costs of any treatment they seek. Over-use of what, up to now, have been regarded as \"free\" health care services might thus be contained to a certain extent. 3.2 Unfinished reform business There is a iot of unfinished business on the German reform agenda. But, at least, Germany has made a start. Our partner states in Europe and elsewhere are~ taking note of this. Now is not the time to take a rest, as we still have a lang way to go before the German economy has truly regaine~d its former dynamism. We need to build on the newly acquired momentum for reform. There has tobe a further improvement in the~ supply side conditions, red tape has to be cut back, and setting-up a business has tobe made easier. The labour market would clearly benefit if employers and employees were allowed to depart from the terms of centralised wage agreements provided jobs can be secured in that way. A general broadening of the scope for non-centralised wage Settlements at the individual company Ievei might also help to improve labour market flexibility.

The rapid ageing of the population will put the systems under further pressure unless they are reformed speedily and thoroughly. ln order to contain the cost dynamics in the health care system without compromising quality, higher Ievels of competition and transparency are needed on the supply side. lnsurance contributions have to be made separate from employment contracts. Funding of the pension system must be broadened. As benefits paid out in the pay as-you-go pension system will have to be cut back for future retirees, private provisioning should be expanded. Furthermore, the younger generations will have to work beyend the present retirement age of 65 years. Postponing reforms in the social security systems will ultimately render them only more costly. 3.3 Fiscal issues Social security systems have contributed significantly to deteriorating public finances. Fiscal consolidation is a priority issue for governments not only in Germany. There must be no further weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact. Modifying the pact would be as short-sighted an option as non compliance. ln the Ionger run, there can be no sound money without so und public finances.

B UND ES BAN K Embargo: February 3, 2004, 06:00p.m. CET Public finances must be consolidated on the expenditure side. This is entirely in line with the objt3ctive of a more subsidiary role for the state. Past experience has also shown it tobe the most effective road to achieving sound public finances. The economic upswing opens a window of opportunity to get serious about fiscal consolidation. An overhaul of the income tax that broadens the tax base while lowering tax rates might help to raise the growth potential of the economy. The ideal tax system would be simple, fair and efficient. That ideal is the benchmark for any upcoming tax reform. Aithough my remarks on necessary reforms referred to the situation in Germany, the problern areas are- albeit to varying degrees basically the same in most European countries: social security systems facing ageing populations, high budget deficits and growth hampering structural rigidities. Especially with regard to such rigidities, the UK's flexible economy is in quite an enviable position. 4 Concluding remark However I arge the need for reform, the euro area has a major asset: its currency. The euro has delivered a high degree of macroeconomic stability previously unknown to most of the 300 million people who now use the single currency.

Should the UK join the euro area? Personally, I would apprec:iate Anglo-Saxon free-market enthusiasm within the Eurosystem. Adopting the single currency would lower transaction costs considerably as the UK and the euro area are already the most important trading partners for each other. lt therefore makes sense to integrate financial and product markets further by having a common currency. I am fully aware of how contentious an issue the euro is in the United Kingdom. Even so, in my humble opinion, the UK joining the euro area would be mutually beneficial. You would be most welcome. * * * Deutsche Bundesbank • Zentrale • Presse und Information • Wilhelm-Epstein-Straße 14 • 60431 Frankfurt am Main www.bundesbank.de • E-Mail: presse-information@bundesbank.de • Tel.: 069 9566-3511 • Fax: 069 9566-3077 Bei publizistischer Verwertung wird um die Angabe der Quelle gebeten.
