I am deeply honored by the trust placed in me by the Executive Board. I would like to thank the Fund’s global membership warmly for the broad-based support I have received. I would also like to express my respect and esteem for my colleague and friend, Agustin CARSTENS.   \n\nThe IMF has served its 187 member countries well during the global economic and financial crisis, transforming itself in many positive ways. I will make it my overriding goal that our institution continues to serve its entire membership with the same focus and the same spirit. As I have had the opportunity to say to the IMF Board during the selection process, the IMF must be relevant, responsive, effective, and legitimate, to achieve stronger and sustainable growth, macroeconomic stability, and a better future for all.\"\n\n\n\n\nContacts Presse :\nCabinet de Christine LAGARDE - Jean-Marc PLANTADE - 01 53 18 41 35\nPresse internationale : Bruno SILVESTRE - 01 53 18 41 35\n© Copyright Ministère de l'Économie, des Finances et de l'Industrie, 28/06/2011", "published_date": "2011-06-28", "section": "Discours"}
