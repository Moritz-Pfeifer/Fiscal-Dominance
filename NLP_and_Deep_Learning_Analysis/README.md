# Testing Text Similarity

This folder contains the scripts for testing various NLP, machine and deep learning models in order to vectorize the texts and divise a similarity score over time. The following models were tested:

1) Jaccard Similiarity
2) TF-IDF + Jaccard
3) TF-IDF + K-means
4) GloVe + Cosine Similarity
5) TF-IDF + Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering + Centroid Based
6) Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)
7) NMF + Jensen-Shannon distance
8) Word Mover Distance
9) Sentence Transformers (SBERT)
