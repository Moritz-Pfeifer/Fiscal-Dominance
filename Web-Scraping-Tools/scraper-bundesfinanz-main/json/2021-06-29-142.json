But he must also signal to potential centrist voters that an SPD chancellor would not rip up rules that, under Merkel, delivered six straight years of balanced budgets and a 10-year economic boom \u2014 the longest in German postwar history.\n\nScholz has insisted, for example, that in 2023 Germany will reinstate its \u201cdebt brake\u201d, the constitutional limit on new borrowing suspended since the start of the pandemic.\n\nBut until then, he said, Germany must continue with policies that have delivered billions in aid to struggling companies. Scholz will borrow an additional \u20ac100bn next year, on top of the \u20ac370bn in new loans approved since the crisis began, and has earmarked \u20ac51.8bn for investments in 2022 and more than \u20ac50bn every year until 2025.\n\nThe borrowing has been controversial. Jens Weidmann, head of the Bundesbank, told a cabinet meeting last week the debt brake should be reintroduced next year, as Scholz originally planned, and not in 2023, saying that rising growth would yield more tax revenues.\n\nScholz argued now is not the time to tighten the rules. Yet he also rejected the opposition Greens\u2019 call to reform the debt brake, saying there was no majority in parliament for that.\n\n\u201cIf the Greens [pursue] the idea of changing the constitution to reform the debt brake, they\u2019re campaigning de facto on a plan that can\u2019t be enforced,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, he argued the debt brake had not prevented \u201crecord volumes of investment\u201d, which rose \u201cfrom \u20ac34bn in 2018, when I came into office, to more than \u20ac50bn in 2022\u201d.\n\nScholz was optimistic about Germany\u2019s economic prospects, with the government expecting growth of 3.5 per cent this year and 3.6 per cent in 2022. He also played down the risk of inflation, which rose to 2.4 per cent in May.\n\nThis, he said, was a \u201ctemporary phenomenon,\u201d due to factors such as a recent rise in value added tax. Others are more concerned: Weidmann said on Monday that German inflation could hit 4 per cent later this year.\n\nScholz\u2019s SPD lags behind Merkel\u2019s CDU/CSU and the Greens in the polls, although some surveys show he is more popular than the centre-right\u2019s leader, Armin Laschet, or Annalena Baerbock of the Greens. He has far more government experience than either, having served as federal labour minister and then mayor of Hamburg, before entering the Merkel cabinet as finance minister and deputy chancellor.\n\nScholz told the FT his election campaign would focus on delivering the \u201cmassive investments\u201d Germany needs to modernise infrastructure, vastly expand renewable energy capacity and achieve carbon neutrality by 2045.\n\n\u201cTo do that you need a strong leader who can make the necessary decisions, change the necessary laws and organise the necessary investments in infrastructure and production capacities,\u201d he said.\n\nAs well as ruling out reform of German borrowing rules, Scholz opposed relaxing the EU\u2019s Stability and Growth Pact, designed to ensure EU member states pursue sound public finances.\n\n\u201cMy view is simple: a common currency needs common rules and our rules have been shown to provide the necessary flexibility,\u201d he said. All the emergency measures adopted by EU states during the pandemic had been \u201cpossible within the framework of the SPG \u2013 so it\u2019s flexible enough\u201d.\n\nThe European Commission waived the Stability and Growth Pact early in the crisis and is set to extend the suspension until the end of 2022. But hawkish northern European countries will probably push for a swift return to strict fiscal rules.\n\nScholz was also cautious when asked whether the recovery fund \u2013 which will see the European Commission take on debt and distribute it to member states as non-refundable grants \u2013 was a step towards a permanent EU borrowing capacity.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a debate we\u2019re having right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a pragmatic politician I focus on the immediate task at hand.\u201d\n\nSuch circumspection contrasts with how he hailed the recovery fund last year as a \u201cHamiltonian moment\u201d, invoking the first US Treasury secretary who helped to create American fiscal union by taking on states\u2019 debts in 1790.\n\nInstead of such lofty discussions, Scholz said the EU should focus on brass tasks, how to develop its \u201cown resources ... to help finance the repayments\u201d.\n\nThese could come from emissions trading, border adjustment mechanisms, a financial transaction tax or a digital levy. \u201cWe should only take one step at a time,\u201d he said."}
