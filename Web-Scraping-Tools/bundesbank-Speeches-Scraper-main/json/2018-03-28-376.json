It\u2019s remarkable that a protective wall has come to be synonymous with an open global financial centre where people from all over the world meet and do business together.\u00a0\u00a0Despite its name, Wall Street has never benefited from walls. Quite the opposite, in fact: it has profited from tearing down walls, from eliminating tax barricades and trade barriers.There are three topics I would like to emphasise in my speech today that all have something to do with walls: First, I would like to offer an outlook on the current political situation in Germany and Europe. As you all know, Germany benefited tremendously\u00a0\u2013 almost 30\u00a0years ago now\u00a0\u2013 from a certain wall being torn down, with the help of our European and American friends. Second, I would like to touch upon monetary policy and economic developments in the euro area, and I am sure that the ECB\u2019s decisions on monetary policy that might be in the pipeline will have an effect on Wall Street. Third, I would like to share a few thoughts on free trade, and on the difficulties and risks posed by walls and barriers in our globalised economies.2\u00a0Current political situation in Germany and EuropeLooking at what the media say about Europe these days, you might be forgiven for thinking that the \u201cold continent\u201d is hurtling towards chaos. A headline of the New York Times springs to mind, which read: \u201cChaos in Catalonia\u201d. The Huffington Post wrote about the \u201cBrexit chaos\u201d. And the Washington Post fears that the EU might even cease to exist: \u201cWhat the E.U. must confront if it wants to survive\u201d.Let me assure you: the future of Europe is not really on the rocks, despite what these headlines might suggest. It is typical for open democratic societies to go from one political controversy to the next. There is no need to badmouth democratic discourse as chaos.\u00a0Recent events in Germany are a good example. There, it has taken quite a while to form of a coalition\u00a0\u2013 longer than ever before in post-war German history, in fact. However, the government remained functional at all times. And even more importantly, an anti-European course was never on the cards, no matter what coalition was formed.This also explains the market response: one might think that the situation in Germany would be perceived as a threat to the economy and that it would therefore send the DAX lower. But the opposite was the case: unlike the reaction to France\u2019s presidential elections in\u00a02017, the market responses to the recent elections in Germany and Italy appeared more benign. This also goes for Catalonia. We see this as a good sign. In the Bundesbank\u2019s view, market participants are acknowledging that economic stability is returning to much of the euro area and that eurosceptic tendencies will be manageable. So you see: Current European political processes do not have an overwhelming impact on economic developments, and the markets have learned to differentiate between actual crises and political controversies.However, now that a new German government has been formed, the reform process in the euro area does need to gain speed. In mid-March, on the very day the new federal cabinet took office, the new German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas immediately travelled to Paris to \u201cseize Macron\u2019s outstretched hand\u201d, as he said. Angela Merkel also promptly travelled to Paris following her re-election in the Bundestag.France and Germany have traditionally been key players in the process of reforming European economic and monetary union. We see a clear desire on both sides, in France and in Germany, to foster reforms. Merkel and Macron have announced a joint roadmap for reforming the euro area, which they intend to present to their European peers in June. However, negotiations will undoubtedly be long and arduous, especially when it comes to minimising risk\u00a0\u2013 which is what the Bundesbank is suggesting\u00a0\u2013 or sharing risk, which is what some other ideas imply.All the reform plans touch upon a key question for Europe: what shape should the EU\u2019s political system take? To what extent do we see the EU as an international, intergovernmental institution, to what extent is it a regime in its own right? The EU has always been a system \u201csui generis\u201d\u00a0\u2013 a set-up unlike any other, which means, it has always been subject to change. The underlying question is this: which competencies need to be at the EU level, which should be kept at the intergovernmental level and which at the national level?In my opinion, before we plan any concrete reforms, we first need a clear economic and political analysis of past crises: to better understand what led to the crises, and to identify, from today\u2019s perspective, which policy measures worked, and which ones didn\u2019t. Building on these insights, we can design tailor-made reforms.\u00a0From my point of view, there are three key questions we have to discuss and resolve:First, there is the conditionality of cross-European support as an underlying principle. We have the Stability and Growth Pact which sets out the fiscal surveillance rules and limits for government deficits and debt. In the Bundesbank\u2019s opinion, monitoring activities under the Stability and Growth Pact should be independent of political institutions, if the assessment is to be a neutral one. For example, the European Stability Mechanism could give such an assessment. Currently, there are debates about reforming the ESM into a \u201cEuropean Monetary Fund\u201d, which might also provide assistance in times of asymmetric economic shocks. In the Bundesbank\u2019s view, it is important to grant financial assistance only subject to proper conditionality. If support is granted with no strings attached, as it were, fiscal stability and responsible budgetary policies will be undermined.Second, we need to sever the sovereign-bank nexus. In the recent crises, struggling sovereigns brought banks to their knees, because European banks hold quite substantial stocks of domestic sovereign bonds on their balance sheets. But the nexus worked in the other direction as well: struggling banks needed government assistance. We need to fix this \u201cdoom loop\u201d. Serving as a backstop for the Single Resolution Fund, the European Monetary Fund could help in taking sovereigns out of the liability cascade. Such a fiscal risk sharing would, however, require a further reduction of legacy risks in bank\u2019s balance sheets. However, we need further steps. The Bundesbank is proposing to reconsider the regulatory treatment of government bonds on bank balance sheets. We are calling for a phasing-out of the current zero-risk weighting and exposure limits for government bonds.Third, we have to find a way to make private risk sharing more effective in the euro area. In the US, about 65\u00a0% of an economic shock in one state is cushioned by private risk sharing in the form of cross-border loss sharing and cross-border borrowing. In the euro area, the percentage is far lower. The capital markets union currently under discussion could tear down walls in Europe\u2019s capital markets. This could enhance private risk sharing and therefore make the euro area more resilient to crises.These are just three glimpses at the debate surrounding the complex issue of reforming European economic and monetary union. Currently, looking at the new governments in France and Germany, we have a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d for reforms, before the elections to the EU Parliament in May\u00a02019 and the election of a new President of the European Commission. However, moving ahead with reforms is not a no-brainer, as different opinions from all member states have to be considered.You will have the opportunity to discuss our ongoing reform process in greater detail with Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau, the Governor of the Banque de France, when he meets you in mid-April.3\u00a0Monetary policy and economic developments in the euro areaThe time is right for reforms in Europe. John F Kennedy said that \u201cthe best time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining\u201d. Jean-Claude Juncker quoted these famous words when he presented the Commission\u2019s reform proposals.And we can definitely say the sun is currently shining. We are observing a broad-based economic recovery in the euro area. The latest ECB staff projection forecasts real GDP growth of 2.4\u00a0% in\u00a02018, of 1.9\u00a0% in\u00a02019, and of 1.7\u00a0% in\u00a02020. This is partly based on significant structural reforms undertaken by several countries. However, given the subdued inflationary pressure in the euro area, an accommodative monetary policy stance remains appropriate.\u00a0In January, the ECB Governing Council dropped its \u201ceasing bias\u201d, as it is known\u00a0\u2013 a long-standing pledge to extend its asset purchases if necessary. In the Bundesbank\u2019s view, the upbeat economy and the inflation forecast would justify bringing the net asset purchases to a rapid end, if the economic recovery in the euro area continues as expected. In a similar vein, market participants are expecting an end until the end of this year. Further decisions are to come in the course of the year.Of course, we at the Bundesbank are keeping a close eye on monetary developments in the US, given the process of policy normalisation. Here, also given the substantial fiscal stimulus, inflationary pressures are finally building up. For now, market participants are expecting the Fed to continue the process of gradually normalising policy. At the same time, Fed watchers are noting the new Fed Chair\u2019s language that \u201cheadwinds are shifting to tailwinds\u201d. This is also what Lael Brainard, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, said at this place just three weeks ago.4\u00a0Remarks on free tradeTo some extent, the economic outlook for the US and the euro area, and thus its monetary policy, will be influenced by trade policy. On the one hand, investors await the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. On the other, investors are uncertain about what the future holds for the \u201cbilateral dealmaking\u201d approach to US trade policy and its interplay with international trade partners.During the post crises economic expansion, WTO members have imposed over\u00a02,000 new trade barriers. This rise in protectionism and the growth in trade restrictions\u00a0\u2013 new walls\u00a0\u2013 are in our view downside risks to the growth outlook. And the markets agree with that judgement, as the market responses to the US tariffs have shown.The Bundesbank is convinced that open markets are important for a dynamic global economy. At the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires last week, the new German Minister of Finance, Olaf Scholz, also underlined the importance of open markets.Openness in trade delivers many benefits: we have larger markets and can therefore better exploit economies of scope and scale. A greater division of labour creates more opportunities for specialisation. Technology and innovation diffuse across borders more quickly. And fiercer competitive pressure can drive up productivity.Free trade is almost always a boon for a country\u2019s entire economy. But not everyone will necessarily derive personal benefits from open markets. After what we have experienced, we need a serious debate about the positive and negative impact, and especially the redistributive effects which global cooperation is having on our societies.But new walls and protectionism cannot be the answer. Instead, we need to focus on making global growth even more inclusive. William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, recently delivered a speech entitled: \u201cMaking globalization work\u201d. That is exactly what we have to do, and I am pleased to note that the central banks around the world seem to agree on this point.In Europe, free trade might become more restricted exactly one year from now when the UK leaves the EU. Last week, the UK and the EU agreed on terms for a 21-months Brexit transition period. For the EU, Brexit is manageable from an economic viewpoint. But we should prepare for different scenarios, even if the talks between the UK and the EU made progress recently, because negotiations on a trade agreement are still to come.Another factor restricting free trade comes in the form of the protective tariffs which the United States partly applied last week\u00a0\u2013 and in the form of the potential response from trading partners. Mario Draghi said at the most recent ECB press conference: \u201cIf you put tariffs against your allies, one wonders who the enemies are.\u201dIn my opinion, we should be thinking not about new walls, but about fresh forms of cooperation. Brexit, for example, could be a trigger for the financial centres in the EU\u00a027 to focus more on cooperation than on rivalry.Today, the EU\u00a027\u2019s overall potential is spread over various locations and has not yet had a cumulative impact. Physical distance has\u00a0\u2013 up to now\u00a0\u2013 prevented EU financial centres from being globally competitive. However, geographical proximity is becoming less important for a financial centre\u00a0\u2013 provided we harness the new technological potential. Digitalisation opens up a totally new perspective for the EU\u00a027\u2019s financial centres: to pool their potential and cooperate as a single digital financial centre\u00a0\u2013 not as a replica of old systems, but as a highly innovative technical project.\u00a0\u00a0To chart a course for a single \u201cDigital City of Europe\u201d, as this project might be called, the financial centres will need to specialise and cooperate, build up a competitive digital infrastructure, and offer a harmonised, perhaps even a common legal framework. Policymakers can act as a catalyst for this \u201cDigital City of Europe\u201d. But of course, market players are the ones who will have to build up and accept a \u201cdigital financial markets union\u201d of this kind.5\u00a0ConclusionLadies and gentlemenLet me sum up my three key points today:First, I see the need to reform European monetary and economic union. Our focus should be on how to prevent and to overcome crises in the future, and we have to make sure we carry out tailor-made reforms that tackle the actual problems that came to light during the last crises.Second, the broad-based economic recovery in the euro area is increasing the likelihood of an adjustment in monetary policy. Third, I fear the rise of barriers to free trade and open markets, in spite of our empirical and theoretical evidence that free trade is almost always a boon for a country\u2019s entire economy.As you can tell, I firmly believe in tearing down walls and not erecting any new ones. Wall Street shows the way forward: it made a name for itself by doing away with its protective wall, and by facilitating trade on the city\u2019s stock exchange.Just like New York, Berlin also got a protective wall in the\u00a017th\u00a0century, with a gate that has since become iconic: the Brandenburg Gate. Remarkably, the Brandenburg Gate was part of the customs wall. In other words, it was a symbol of economic protectionism. During the Cold War, it became a symbol of the conflict between East and West. In\u00a01987, the then US president Ronald Reagan chose that very site to challenge his Soviet counterpart Mikhail Gorbachev with the words: \u201cIf you seek peace, if you seek prosperity [\u2026], if you seek liberalisation, [\u2026] tear down this wall!\u201dBearing this in mind, we would all be better off if we avoided raising any new walls\u00a0\u2013 and that goes just as much for the United States as it does for Europe.Thank you for your attention."}
