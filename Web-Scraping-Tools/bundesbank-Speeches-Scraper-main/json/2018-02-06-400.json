But today we are even going to top that. Our speaker has held all these positions\u00a0\u2013 not at the same time, but at some point in his career.I am talking about Agust\u00edn Carstens. After graduating with a PhD from the University of Chicago, Agust\u00edn, you began your career at the Central Bank of Mexico. You then became Executive Director at the IMF before being appointed Mexico\u2019s Deputy Finance Minister and then Deputy Managing Director at the IMF. In\u00a02006 you returned to Mexico City from Washington to serve as minister of finance.It was in this position\u00a0\u2013 and this is rather unusual for a finance minister\u00a0\u2013 that you earned something of a reputation in the oil market. In\u00a02008 you insured Mexico\u2019s oil revenues against lower oil prices\u00a0\u2013 a move that earned Mexico $8.5\u00a0billion in\u00a02009. Some traders joked that you were that year\u2019s most successful, but worst paid oil manager.The finance ministry was by no means the end of your career. Between\u00a02010 and\u00a02017 you served as Governor of the Bank of Mexico.\u00a0And in December last year you added the most recent entry to your CV when you became General Manager of the BIS. You are an excellent choice for the position, and I am already looking forward to working with you in Basel. I\u00a0am certain the BIS will benefit from your enormous experience. This experience manifests itself not only in the long list of positions you have held in your impressive career, but also in the economic events you have witnessed during that time.It is safe to say that your career has been highly eventful in this respect. In the\u00a01990s, when you headed the research department at the Banco de Mexico, Mexico went through what was referred to as the Tequila crisis, when it encountered difficulties in financing its large current account deficits. And in\u00a02008, as Mexico\u2019s minister of finance, you helped coordinate an international response to the global financial crisis in the G20.It was during that time that we first met, and I was impressed by your strong push for an international response to the crisis. It helped prevent the world from falling back into trade protectionism and an even deeper recession. And it established the G20 as the key body for international economic cooperation\u00a0\u2013 not only in the field of financial market regulation.The common efforts of the\u00a0G20 demonstrated that multilateral cooperation does work. A message which is worth repeating these days, when some countries never seem to tire of doubting the meaning of multilateral agreements.Agust\u00edn, at the height of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, you allowed the euro area to benefit from your vast experience. In a\u00a02013 speech you drew on lessons from Mexico\u2019s Tequila crisis for the euro area.[1] Two of your conclusions were that \u201can exchange rate system [or a common currency] cannot be a substitute for policy discipline\u201d. And you also pointed out that fiscal discipline needs to be maintained after the crisis. This is very close to our thinking here at the Bundesbank.It also appeared to me that, at that time, you were tactfully trying to remind us in the euro area to make progress in crisis resolution. I am aware that many considered the sovereign debt crisis to be a risk for the global economy.That is why I am happy to be able to state that matters have improved substantially since then. The euro area has switched from being a drag on growth to a driver of growth. In\u00a02017 the euro area grew slightly faster than the average of the advanced economies.The greatest risk now would be to assume that all the problems have been solved. Shocks in specific region or specific sectors of the economy can still subject the euro area to an endurance test\u00a0\u2013 despite the progress that has been made in the past years.But at least the times when, first the financial, and then the sovereign debt crisis required the full attention of policy makers, regulators and bank supervisors are behind us.We are now able to turn some of our attention to other important issues, one of which is undoubtedly the digitalisation of finance. The Bundesbank placed this topic on the agenda of the G20 during Germany\u2019s presidency last year.One important aspect of this issue we weren\u2019t able to look at within the framework of the G20 concerns the possibilities and risks that come with the issuance of digital tokens or even digital central bank money. The question whether new technology fundamentally changes the foundations of central banking has become a topic of increasing debate among central bankers.Agust\u00edn, your talk today is most welcome because it will contribute to an objectification of the debate and will constitute an important input for our policy deliberations. I am very happy that we were able to attract such a distinguished speaker for this task.Fire away. The floor is yours.FootnoteAgustin Carstens (2013).
